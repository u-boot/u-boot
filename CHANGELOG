======================================================================
Changes since U-Boot 1.1.4:
======================================================================

* Fix Lite5200B support: initialize SDelay register
  See Freescale's AN3221 "MPC5200B SDRAM Initialization and
  Configuration", 3.3.1 SDelay--MBAR + 0x0190

* Changes/fixes for drivers/cfi_flash.c:

  - Add Intel legacy lock/unlock support to common CFI driver

    On some Intel flash's (e.g. Intel J3) legacy unlocking is
    supported, meaning that unlocking of one sector will unlock
    all sectors of this bank. Using this feature, unlocking
    of all sectors upon startup (via env var "unlock=yes") will
    get much faster.

  - Fixed problem with multiple reads of envronment variable
    "unlock" as pointed out by Reinhard Arlt & Anders Larsen.

  - Removed unwanted linefeeds from "protect" command when
    CFG_FLASH_PROTECTION is enabled.

  - Changed p3p400 board to use CFG_FLASH_PROTECTION

  Patch by Stefan Roese, 01 Apr 2006

* Changes/fixes for drivers/cfi_flash.c:
  - Correctly handle the cases where CFG_HZ != 1000 (several
    XScale-based boards)
  - Fix the timeout calculation of buffered writes (off by a
    factor of 1000)
  Patch by Anders Larsen, 31 Mar 2006

* Updates to common PPC4xx onboard (DDR)SDRAM init code (405 and 440)

  405 SDRAM: - The SDRAM parameters can now be defined in the board
               config file and the 405 SDRAM controller values will
               be calculated upon bootup (see PPChameleonEVB).
               When those settings are not defined in the board
               config file, the register setup will be as it is now,
               so this implementation should not break any current
               design using this code.

               Thanks to Andrea Marson from DAVE for this patch.

  440 DDR:   - Added function sdram_tr1_set to auto calculate the
               TR1 value for the DDR.
             - Added ECC support (see p3p440).

  Patch by Stefan Roese, 17 Mar 2006

    make it work with the Monahans.
  - Make Monahans clock frequency configurable using
    CFG_MONAHANS_RUN_MODE_OSC_RATIO and
    CFG_MONAHANS_TURBO_RUN_MODE_RATIO.
  Merge from Markus Klotzbücher's repo, 25 Mar 2006

* Apply SoC concept to arm926ejs CPUs, i.e. move the SoC specific
  timer and cpu_reset code from cpu/$(CPU) into the new
  cpu/$(CPU)/$(SOC) directories
  Patch by Andreas Engel, 13 Mar 2006

* Change max size of uncompressed uImage's to 8MByte and add
  CFG_BOOTM_LEN to adjust this setting.

  As mentioned by Robin Getz on 2005-05-24 the size of uncompressed
  uImages was restricted to 4MBytes. This default size is now
  increased to 8Mbytes and can be overrided by setting CFG_BOOTM_LEN
  in the board config file.

  incorrectly generating start/stop conditions on the bus.
  Patch by Andrew Dyer, 26 Jul 2005

* Fix bug in [id]cache_status commands for MPC85xx processors;

  We need to adjust the bus number we are trying to access based
  on which PCI controller its on
  Patch by Kumar Gala, 12 Jan 2006

* Report back PCI bus when doing table based device config
  Patch by Kumar Gala, 11 Jan 2006

* Added support for PCI prefetchable region and BARs
  If a host controller sets up a region as prefetchable and
  a device's BAR denotes it as prefetchable, allocate the
  BAR into the prefetch region.

  If a BAR is prefetchable and no prefetchable region has
  been setup by the controller we fall back to allocating
  the BAR into the normally memory region.

  Patches by Peter Korsgaard/Tolunay Orkun, 26 May 2005

* Cleanup compiler warnings.
  Patch by Greg Ungerer, 21 May 2005

* Word alignment fixes for word aligned NS16550 UART
  Patch by Jean-Paul Saman, 01 Mar 2005

  Fixes bug with UART that only supports word aligned access: removed
  "__attribute__ ((packed));" for "(CFG_NS16550_REG_SIZE == 4)" some
  (broken!) versions of GCC generate byte accesses when encountering
  the packed attribute regardless if the struct is already correctly
  aligned for a platform. Peripherals that can only handle word
  aligned access won't work properly when accessed with byte access.
  The struct NS16550 is already word aligned for REG_SIZE = 4, so
  there is no need to packed the struct in that case.

* Fix behaviour if gatewayip is not set
  Patch by Robin Gilks, 23 Dec 2004

  use hush shell.

* Convert mcc200 to use common CFI flash driver
  Patch by Stefan Roese, 28 Feb 2006

* Add env-variable "unlock" to handle initial state of sectors
  (locked/unlocked).

  Only the U-Boot image and it's environment is protected,
  all other sectors are unprotected (unlocked) if flash
  hardware protection is used (CFG_FLASH_PROTECTION) and
  the environment variable "unlock" is set to "yes".

  Patch by Stefan Roese, 28 Feb 2006

* Update drivers/cfi_flash.c:
  - find_sector() called in both versions of flash_write_cfiword()
  Patch by Peter Pearse, 27th Feb 2006

* CFI support for a x8/x16 AMD/Spansion flash configured in x8 mode
  Patch by Jose Maria Lopez, 16 Jan 2006

* Add support for AMD/Spansion Flashes in flash_write_cfibuffer
  Patch by Alex Bastos and Thomas Schaefer, 2005-08-29

* Changes/fixes for drivers/cfi_flash.c:
  We *should* check if there are any error bits if the previous call
  returned ERR_OK (Otherwise we will have output an error message in
  flash_status_check() already.)  The original code would only check for
  error bits if flash_status_check() returns ERR_TIMEOUT.
  Patch by Marcus Hall, 23 Aug 2005

* Changes/fixes for drivers/cfi_flash.c:
  - Add CFG_FLASH_PROTECT_CLEAR on drivers/cfi_flash.c
  - Prohibit buffer write when buffer_size is 1 on drivers/cfi_flash.c
  Patch by Sangmoon Kim, 19 Aug 2005

* Fixes for drivers/cfi_flash.c:
  - Fix wrong timeout value usage in flash_status_check()
  - Round write_tout up when converting to msec in flash_get_size()
  - Remove clearing flash status at the end of flash_write_cfibuffer()
    which sets Intel 28F640J3 flash back to command mode on CSB472
  Patch by Tolunay Orkun, 02 July 2005

* Add basic support for the SMMACO4 Board from PanDaCom.
  Patch by Heiko Schocher, 20 Feb 2006

* Add GIT version information (commid ID) to untagged U-Boot versions

  As done in the linux kernel, the U-Boot version (U_BOOT_VERSION)
  of all unreleased (untagged) U-Boot images will be automatically
  extended upon compiletime with a part of the GIT commit ID and
  possibly with "dirty" if uncommited changes are detected.

  Here an example for the resulting version:
  "U-Boot 1.1.4-g3457ac18-dirty"

  The version is now maintained in the toplevel Makefile and the
  version headers are autogenerated.

  Patch by Stefan Roese, 9 Feb 2006

* Update default environment for INKA4x00 board.

* Convert CPCI750 to use common CFI flash driver
  Patch by Reinhard Arlt, 8 Feb 2006

* Various changes to esd HH405 board specific files
  Patch by Matthias Fuchs, 07 Feb 2006

* Cleanup U-Boot boot messages on ARM.

  To match the U-Boot user interface on ARM platforms to the U-Boot
  standard (as on PPC platforms), some messages with debug character
  are removed from the default U-Boot build.
  Enable DEBUG for lib_arm/board.c to enable debug messages.
  New CONFIG_DISPLAY_CPUINFO and CONFIG_DISPLAY_BOARDINFO options.
  Patch  by Stefan Roese, 24 Jan 2006

* Fix various compiler warnings on ppc4xx builds (ELDK 4.0)
  Patch by Stefan Roese, 18 Jan 2006

* Add VGA support (CT69000) to CPCI750 board.
  Insert missing __le32_to_cpu() for filesize in ext2fs_read_file().
  Patch by Reinhard Arlt, 30 Dec 2005

  Patch by Eugen Bigz, 19 Dec 2005

======================================================================
Changes for U-Boot 1.1.4:
======================================================================

* Changes to Yellowstone & Yosemite 440EP/GR eval boards:
  - Changed GPIO setup to enable another address line in order to
    address 64M of FLASH.
  - Added function sdram_tr1_set to auto calculate the tr1 value for
    the DDR.
  Patch by Steven Blakeslee, 12 Dec 2005

* MPC5200:  Set PCI retry counter to 0 = infinite retry;
  The default of 255 is too short for slow devices.
  Patch by Martin Nykodym, 12 Dec 2005

* Change port configuration for O2DNT (CODEC1 on PSC1).

* Fix register for PCI async mode on PPC440EP
  Patch by Youngchul Bang, 08 Dec 2005

* Fix U-Boot linking problems (add .eh_frame segment to linker script)
  This segment may be required by some libgcc.a functions
  (like _udivdi3).

* Fix DPRAM offset/size for MPC8541/8555.
  Simplify TQM85xx Makefile handling.

* Fix data overflow (typo?) in rtc/ds1302.c

* Fix U-Boot compilation for MIPS boards using ELDK 4.0

* Add support for TQM8541/8555 boards, TQM85xx support reworked:
  - Support for TQM8541/8555 boards added.
  - Complete rework of TQM8540/8560 support.
  - Common TQM85xx code now supports all current TQM85xx platforms
    (TQM8540/8541/8555/8560).
  - DDR SDRAM size detection added.
  - CAS latency default values can be overwritten by setting "serial#"
    to e.g. "ABC0001 casl=25" -> CAS latency 2.5 will be used.
    If problems are detected with this non default CAS latency,
    the default values will be used instead.
  - Flash size detection added.
  - Moved FCC ethernet driver initialization behind TSEC driver init
    -> TSEC is first device.
  Patch by Stefan Roese, 30 Nov 2005

* Add support for AMCC 440SP, add support for AMCC Luan 440SP eval board.
  Patch by John Otken, 23 Nov 2005

* Changed PPC44x startup message (cpu info, speed...) to common style:
  On PPC44x platforms, the startup message generated in "cpu.c" only
  comprised the ppc type and revision but not additional information
  like speed etc. Those speed infos where printed in the board specific
  code. This new implementation now prints all CPU infos in the common
  cpu specific code. No board specific code is needed anymore and
  therefore removed from all current 44x implementations.
  Patch by Stefan Roese, 27 Nov 2005

* Adjust TQM834x PHY addresses for latest hardware revision.

* Increase malloc arena on TQM5200 board to 256 kB.
  With 64 kb uniform flash sector size the old value of 128 kB was
  too small.

* Fix miiphy global data initialization (problem on 4xx boards when
  no ethaddr is assigned). Initialization moved from
  miiphy_register() to eth_initialize().

  Based on initial patch for 4xx platform by Matthias Fuchs.

* Remove unnnecessary #include <linux/types.h> from include/asm-*/u-boot.h

* Allow use of include/image.h and include/asm-*/u-boot.h in proprietary code.
  The COPYING file was extended to make clear that these files can be
  used in non-GPL code, too.
  Also, a corresponding note was placed in the headers of the affected files.

* Add support for Prodrive P3P440 board:
  - Added onboard PPC440 DDR autodetection in cpu/ppc/sdram.c
  - CFG_FLASH_QUIET_TEST added to use the common CFI driver
    for bank autodetection
  Patch by Stefan Roese, 22 Nov 2005

* Change all '$(...)' variable references into '${...}'
  which makes the environment compatible with the hush shell.
  WARNING: Support for the old '$(...)' syntax will be
  discontinued in a later version.

* Minor changes to init flags in TQM834x PCI.

* Fix Bamboo DDR SDRAM initialization (problem with onboard SDRAM)
  Patch by Stefan Roese, 15 Nov 2005

* New PPC 405EP board added: CMS700
  Added CONFIG_NET_MULTI for VOM405 board.
  Added reset_phy() for VOM405 board.
  Patch by Matthias Fuchs, 09 Nov 2005

* Updated PCI mapping for esd CPCI2DP board.
  Add support for error LED.
  Patch by Matthias Fuchs, 07 Nov 2005

  Patch by Stefan Roese, 07 Nov 2005

* Correct PPC Timebase register definitions (SPRN_TBRL...)
  Patch by Stefan Roese, 07 Nov 2005

* Adjust bd->bi_flashstart on Yellowstone & Yosemite to correct size
  Patch by Stefan Roese, 05 Nov 2005

* Additional fix for external IRQ config on Yellowstone & Yosemite
  Patch by Stefan Roese, 03 Nov 2005

* Add support for Ocotea pass 3 with 440GX Rev. F
  Patch by Stefan Roese, 01 Nov 2005

* Fix external IRQ configuration on Yellowstone & Yosemite
  Patch by Stefan Roese, 28 Oct 2005

* Add support for multiple PHYs.
  Tested on the following boards:
	cmcpu2      (at91rm9200/ether.c)
	PPChameleon (ppc4xx/4xx_enet.c)
	yukon       (mpc8220/fec.c)
	uc100       (mpc8xx/fec.c)
	tqm834x     (mpc834x/tsec.c) with EEPRO100
	lite5200    (mpc5xxx/fec.c) with EEPRO100 card (drivers/eepro100.c)
  Main changes include:
  common/miiphyutil.c
  - miiphy_register routine was added to allow multiple PHYs to be registered
  - miiphy_read and miiphy_write are now defined in this file, and
    require additional argument (char *devname)
  - other miiphy_* routines also require additional device name argument
  ../lib_i386/board.c
  ../lib_ppc/board.c
  Calling reset_phy() was moved to be executed *after* eth_initialize().
  This is necessary as now some of the implementations of reset_phy()
  may need to use miiphy_reset() which is not allowed before eth_initialize()
  as eth_initialize registers all required miiphy_* routines.
  Tested on IP860 and PHY initializes properly after this change.

* Correct includes for flat tree builder.

* Fix conflicting types (flash_write()) in trab auto_update.c.

* Add PCI support for the TQM834x board.

* Add support for AP1000 board.
  Patch by James MacAulay, 07 Oct 2005

* Eliminate hard-coded address of Ethernet transfer buffer on at91rm9200
  Patch by Anders Larsen, 07 Oct 2005

  The Atmel errata #11 states that the transfer buffer descriptor
  table must be aligned on a 16-word boundary. As it turned out, this
  is insufficient - it seems the table must be aligned on a boundary
  at least as large as the table itself (in Linux this is not an
  issue - the table is aligned on a PAGE_SIZE (4096) boundary).

* Fixed compilation for ARM when using a (standard) hard-FP toolchain
  Patch by Anders Larsen, 07 Oct 2005

* Cleanup warnings for cpu/arm720t & cpu/arm1136 files.
  sed the linker scripts, rather than pre-process them.

* Fix warnings for PCI code on ixp
  Patch by Joe <lgxue@yahoo.com>, 13 Jan 2005

* virtex2 fix for bogus download error messages
  The virtex2 FPGA download code watches for init going active during
  a download of config data as an error condition. init also goes
  active after a configuration is finished in concert with the done
  signal. So far, the code does not check for done active until all
  of the configuration data is sent. If configuration data has a few
  extra pad bytes at the end, this would cause an error message even
  though the download had suceeded.
  NOTE: virtex2 slave serial and spartan2 versions may still have the
  same problem.

  Patch by Stefan Roese, 08 Aug 2005

* Fix compiler warnings with older GCC versions

* Add common (with Linux) MTD partition scheme and "mtdparts" command

  Old, obsolete and duplicated code was cleaned up and replace by the
  new partitioning method. There are two possible approaches now:

  The first one is to define a single, static partition:

  #undef CONFIG_JFFS2_CMDLINE
  #define CONFIG_JFFS2_DEV               "nor0"
  #define CONFIG_JFFS2_PART_SIZE         0xFFFFFFFF	/* use whole device */
  #define CONFIG_JFFS2_PART_SIZE         0x00100000	/* use 1MB */
  #define CONFIG_JFFS2_PART_OFFSET       0x00000000

  The second method uses the mtdparts command line option and dynamic
  partitioning:

  /* mtdparts command line support */
  #define CONFIG_JFFS2_CMDLINE
  #define MTDIDS_DEFAULT         "nor1=zuma-1,nor2=zuma-2"
  #define MTDPARTS_DEFAULT       "mtdparts=zuma-1:-(jffs2),zuma-2:-(user)"

  Command line of course produces bigger images, and may be inappropriate
  for some targets, so by default it's off.

    CONFIG_CRC32_VERIFY to enable it)

    1. fix compilation problems for boards that use dynamic
       allocation of DPRAM
    2. shut down FEC after network transfers

* Patches by Pantelis Antoniou, 30 Mar 2004:
  - add auto-complete support to the U-Boot CLI
  - add support for NETTA and NETPHONE boards; fix NETVIA board
  - add support for the Epson 156x series of graphical displays
    (These displays are serial and not suitable for using a normal
    framebuffer console on them)
  - add infrastructure needed in order to POST any DSPs in a board
  - improve and fix various things in the MPC8xx FEC driver:
    1. The new 87x and 88x series of processors have two FECs,
       and the new driver supports them both.
    2. Another change in the 87x/88x series is support for
       the RMII (Reduced MII) interface. However numerous
       changes are needed to make it work since the PHYs
       are connected to the same lines. That means that
       you have to address them correctly over the MII
       interface.
    3. We now correctly match the MII/RMII interface
       configuration to what the PHY reports.
  - Fix problem when readingthe MII status register. Due to the
    internal design of many PHYs you have to read the register
    twice. The problem is more apparent in 10Mbit mode.
  - add new mode ".jffs2s" for reading from a NAND device: it just
    skips over bad blocks.
  - add networking support for VLANs (802.1q), and CDP (Cisco
    Discovery Protocol)
  - some minor patches / cleanup

* Patch by Yuli Barcohen, 28 Mar 2004:

* Patches by Murray Jensen, 17 Jun 2003:
  - Hymod board database mods: add "who" field and new xilinx chip types
  - provide new "init_cmd_timeout()" function so code external to
    "common/main.c" can use the "reset_cmd_timeout()" function before
    entering the main loop
  - add DTT support for adm1021 (new file dtt/adm1021.c; config
    slightly different. see include/configs/hymod.h for an example
    (requires CONFIG_DTT_ADM1021, CONFIG_DTT_SENSORS, and
    CFG_DTT_ADM1021 defined)
  - add new "eeprom_probe()" function which has similar args and
    behaves in a similar way to "eeprom_read()" etc.
  - add 8260 FCC ethernet loopback code (new "eth_loopback_test()"
    function which is enabled by defining CONFIG_ETHER_LOOPBACK_TEST)
  - gdbtools copyright update
  - ensure that set_msr() executes the "sync" and "isync" instructions
    after the "mtmsr" instruction in cpu/mpc8260/interrupts.c
  - 8260 I/O ports fix: Open Drain should be set last when configuring
  - add SIU IRQ defines for 8260
  - allow LDSCRIPT override and OBJCFLAGS initialization: change to
    config.mk to allow board configurations to override the GNU
    linker script, selected via the LDSCRIPT, make variable, and to
    give an initial value to the OBJCFLAGS make variable
  - 8260 i2c enhancement:
    o correctly extends the timeout depending on the size of all
      queued messages for both transmit and receive
    o will not continue with receive if transmit times out
    o ensures that the error callback is done for all queued tx
      and rx messages
    o correctly detects both tx and rx timeouts, only delivers one to
      the callback, and does not overwrite an earlier error
    o logic in i2c_probe now correct
  - add "vprintf()" function so that "panic()" function can be
    technically correct
  - many Hymod board changes

  "include/net.h") for EEPRO100 based boards (especially SP8240)
  which showed "Receiver is not ready" errors when U-Boot was
  processing the receive buffers slower than the network controller
  was filling them.

* Patch by Andreas Oberritter, 09 Nov 2002:
  Change behaviour of NetLoop(): return -1 for errors, filesize
  otherwise; return code 0 is valid an means no file loaded - in this
  case the environment still gets updated!

* Patches by Jon Diekema, 9 Nov 2002:
  - improve ADC/DAC clocking on the SACSng board to align
    the failing edges of LRCLK and SCLK
  - sbc8260 configuration tweaks
  - add status LED support for 82xx systems
  - wire sspi/sspo commands into command handler; improved error
    handlering
  - add timestamp support and alternate memory test to the
    SACSng configuration

* Patch by Vince Husovsky, 7 Nov 2002:
  Add "-n" to linker options to get rid of "Not enough room for
  program headers" problem

* Patch by David Müller, 05 Nov 2002
  Rename CONFIG_PLL_INPUT_FREQ to CONFIG_SYS_CLK_FREQ
