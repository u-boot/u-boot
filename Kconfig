config LOCALVERSION

	  Append an extra string to the end of your U-Boot version.
	  This will show up in your boot log, for example.
	  The string you set here will be appended after the contents of
	  any files with a filename matching localversion* in your
	  object and source tree, in that order.  Your total string can
	  be a maximum of 64 characters.

config LOCALVERSION_AUTO
	bool "Automatically append version information to the version string"
	default y
	help
	  This will try to automatically determine if the current tree is a
	  release tree by looking for Git tags that belong to the current
	  top of tree revision.

	  A string of the format -gxxxxxxxx will be added to the localversion
	  if a Git-based tree is found.  The string generated by this will be
	  appended after any matching localversion* files, and after the value
	  set in CONFIG_LOCALVERSION.

	  (The actual string used here is the first eight characters produced
	  by running the command:

	    $ git rev-parse --verify HEAD

config OPTIMIZE_INLINING
	bool "Allow compiler to uninline functions marked 'inline' in full U-Boot"
	help
	  This option determines if U-Boot forces gcc to inline the functions

	  This option enables Link Time Optimization (LTO), a mechanism which
	  allows the compiler to optimize between different compilation units.

	  This can optimize away dead code paths, resulting in smaller binary
	  size (if CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE is enabled).

	  This option is not available for every architecture and may
	  introduce bugs.

	  Currently, when compiling with GCC, due to a weird bug regarding
	  jobserver, the final linking will not respect make's --jobs argument.
	  Instead all available processors will be used (as reported by the

	  Enabling this option will make U-Boot be run as a bootloader

	  Xen is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) or a type-1 hypervisor with support
	  for para-virtualization. Xen can organize the safe execution of several
	  virtual machines on the same physical system with performance close to
	  native. It is used as the basis for a number of different commercial and
	  open source applications, such as: server virtualization, Infrastructure
	  as a Service (IaaS), desktop virtualization, security applications,
	  embedded and hardware appliances.
	  Xen has a special VM called Domain-0 that runs the Dom0 kernel and allows
	  Xen to use the device drivers for the Domain-0 kernel by default.

	  Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis

	  in U-Boot. It relies on knowing when heap blocks are allocated in
	  order to give accurate results. This happens automatically for
	  standard allocator functions provided by the host OS. However, this
	  doesn't automatically happen for U-Boot's malloc implementation.

	  Enable this option to annotate U-Boot's malloc implementation so that

	  This setting is enabled by default. The reserved malloc
	  memory is initialized with zeros, so first malloc calls
	  will return the pointer to the zeroed memory. But this
	  slows the boot time.

	  It is recommended to disable it, when CONFIG_SYS_MALLOC_LEN
	  value, has more than few MiB, e.g. when uses bzip2 or bmp logo.
	  Then the boot time can be significantly reduced.
	  Warning:
	  When disabling this, please check if malloc calls, maybe

	  It may happen that one needs to move the dynamic allocation
	  from one to another memory range, eg. when moving the malloc
	  from the limited static to a potentially large dynamic (DDR)
