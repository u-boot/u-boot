Summary:
========

This directory contains the source code for U-Boot, a boot loader for
Embedded boards based on PowerPC, ARM, MIPS and several other
processors, which can be installed in a boot ROM and used to
initialize and test the hardware or to download and run application
code.

The development of U-Boot is closely related to Linux: some parts of
the source code originate in the Linux source tree, we have some
header files in common, and special provision has been made to
support booting of Linux images.

Some attention has been paid to make this software easily
configurable and extendable. For instance, all monitor commands are
implemented with the same call interface, so that it's very easy to
add new commands. Also, instead of permanently adding rarely used
code (for instance hardware test utilities) to the monitor, you can
load and run it dynamically.


Status:
=======

In general, all boards for which a configuration option exists in the
Makefile have been tested to some extent and can be considered
"working". In fact, many of them are used in production systems.

In case of problems see the CHANGELOG and CREDITS files to find out
who contributed the specific port. The MAINTAINERS file lists board
maintainers.

Software Configuration:
=======================

Configuration is usually done using C preprocessor defines; the
rationale behind that is to avoid dead code whenever possible.

There are two classes of configuration variables:

* Configuration _OPTIONS_:
  These are selectable by the user and have names beginning with
  "CONFIG_".

* Configuration _SETTINGS_:
  These depend on the hardware etc. and should not be meddled with if
  you don't know what you're doing; they have names beginning with
  "CONFIG_SYS_".

Later we will add a configuration tool - probably similar to or even
identical to what's used for the Linux kernel. Right now, we have to
do the configuration by hand, which means creating some symbolic
links and editing some configuration files. We use the TQM8xxL boards
as an example here.


Selection of Processor Architecture and Board Type:
---------------------------------------------------

For all supported boards there are ready-to-use default
configurations available; just type "make <board_name>_config".

Example: For a TQM823L module type:

	cd u-boot
	make TQM823L_config

For the Cogent platform, you need to specify the CPU type as well;
e.g. "make cogent_mpc8xx_config". And also configure the cogent
directory according to the instructions in cogent/README.


Configuration Options:
----------------------

Configuration depends on the combination of board and CPU type; all
such information is kept in a configuration file
"include/configs/<board_name>.h".

Example: For a TQM823L module, all configuration settings are in
"include/configs/TQM823L.h".


Many of the options are named exactly as the corresponding Linux
kernel configuration options. The intention is to make it easier to
build a config tool - later.


The following options need to be configured:

- CPU Type:	Define exactly one, e.g. CONFIG_MPC85XX.

- Board Type:	Define exactly one, e.g. CONFIG_MPC8540ADS.

- CPU Daughterboard Type: (if CONFIG_ATSTK1000 is defined)
		Define exactly one, e.g. CONFIG_ATSTK1002

- CPU Module Type: (if CONFIG_COGENT is defined)
		Define exactly one of
		CONFIG_CMA286_60_OLD
--- FIXME --- not tested yet:
		CONFIG_CMA286_60, CONFIG_CMA286_21, CONFIG_CMA286_60P,
		CONFIG_CMA287_23, CONFIG_CMA287_50

- Motherboard Type: (if CONFIG_COGENT is defined)
		Define exactly one of
		CONFIG_CMA101, CONFIG_CMA102

- Motherboard I/O Modules: (if CONFIG_COGENT is defined)
		Define one or more of
		CONFIG_CMA302

- Motherboard Options: (if CONFIG_CMA101 or CONFIG_CMA102 are defined)
		Define one or more of
		CONFIG_LCD_HEARTBEAT	- update a character position on
					  the LCD display every second with
					  a "rotator" |\-/|\-/

- Board flavour: (if CONFIG_MPC8260ADS is defined)
		CONFIG_ADSTYPE
		Possible values are:
			CONFIG_SYS_8260ADS	- original MPC8260ADS
			CONFIG_SYS_8266ADS	- MPC8266ADS
			CONFIG_SYS_PQ2FADS	- PQ2FADS-ZU or PQ2FADS-VR
			CONFIG_SYS_8272ADS	- MPC8272ADS

- Marvell Family Member
		CONFIG_SYS_MVFS		- define it if you want to enable
					  multiple fs option at one time
					  for marvell soc family

- MPC824X Family Member (if CONFIG_MPC824X is defined)
		Define exactly one of
		CONFIG_MPC8240, CONFIG_MPC8245

- 8xx CPU Options: (if using an MPC8xx CPU)
		CONFIG_8xx_GCLK_FREQ	- deprecated: CPU clock if
					  get_gclk_freq() cannot work
					  e.g. if there is no 32KHz
					  reference PIT/RTC clock
		CONFIG_8xx_OSCLK	- PLL input clock (either EXTCLK
					  or XTAL/EXTAL)

- 859/866/885 CPU options: (if using a MPC859 or MPC866 or MPC885 CPU):
		CONFIG_SYS_8xx_CPUCLK_MIN
		CONFIG_SYS_8xx_CPUCLK_MAX
		CONFIG_8xx_CPUCLK_DEFAULT
			See doc/README.MPC866

		CONFIG_SYS_MEASURE_CPUCLK

		Define this to measure the actual CPU clock instead
		of relying on the correctness of the configured
		values. Mostly useful for board bringup to make sure
		the PLL is locked at the intended frequency. Note
		that this requires a (stable) reference clock (32 kHz
		RTC clock or CONFIG_SYS_8XX_XIN)

		CONFIG_SYS_DELAYED_ICACHE

		Define this option if you want to enable the
		ICache only when Code runs from RAM.

- 85xx CPU Options:
		CONFIG_SYS_FSL_TBCLK_DIV

		Defines the core time base clock divider ratio compared to the
		system clock.  On most PQ3 devices this is 8, on newer QorIQ
		devices it can be 16 or 32.  The ratio varies from SoC to Soc.

		CONFIG_SYS_FSL_PCIE_COMPAT

		Defines the string to utilize when trying to match PCIe device
		tree nodes for the given platform.

- Intel Monahans options:
		CONFIG_SYS_MONAHANS_RUN_MODE_OSC_RATIO

		Defines the Monahans run mode to oscillator
		ratio. Valid values are 8, 16, 24, 31. The core
		frequency is this value multiplied by 13 MHz.

		CONFIG_SYS_MONAHANS_TURBO_RUN_MODE_RATIO

		Defines the Monahans turbo mode to oscillator
		ratio. Valid values are 1 (default if undefined) and
		2. The core frequency as calculated above is multiplied
		by this value.

- MIPS CPU options:
		CONFIG_SYS_INIT_SP_OFFSET

		Offset relative to CONFIG_SYS_SDRAM_BASE for initial stack
		pointer. This is needed for the temporary stack before
		relocation.

		CONFIG_SYS_MIPS_CACHE_MODE

		Cache operation mode for the MIPS CPU.
		See also arch/mips/include/asm/mipsregs.h.
		Possible values are:
			CONF_CM_CACHABLE_NO_WA
			CONF_CM_CACHABLE_WA
			CONF_CM_UNCACHED
			CONF_CM_CACHABLE_NONCOHERENT
			CONF_CM_CACHABLE_CE
			CONF_CM_CACHABLE_COW
			CONF_CM_CACHABLE_CUW
			CONF_CM_CACHABLE_ACCELERATED

		CONFIG_SYS_XWAY_EBU_BOOTCFG

		Special option for Lantiq XWAY SoCs for booting from NOR flash.
		See also arch/mips/cpu/mips32/start.S.

		CONFIG_XWAY_SWAP_BYTES

		Enable compilation of tools/xway-swap-bytes needed for Lantiq
		XWAY SoCs for booting from NOR flash. The U-Boot image needs to
		be swapped if a flash programmer is used.

- Linux Kernel Interface:
		CONFIG_CLOCKS_IN_MHZ

		U-Boot stores all clock information in Hz
		internally. For binary compatibility with older Linux
		kernels (which expect the clocks passed in the
		bd_info data to be in MHz) the environment variable
		"clocks_in_mhz" can be defined so that U-Boot
		converts clock data to MHZ before passing it to the
		Linux kernel.
		When CONFIG_CLOCKS_IN_MHZ is defined, a definition of
		"clocks_in_mhz=1" is automatically included in the
		default environment.

		CONFIG_MEMSIZE_IN_BYTES		[relevant for MIPS only]

		When transferring memsize parameter to linux, some versions
		expect it to be in bytes, others in MB.
		Define CONFIG_MEMSIZE_IN_BYTES to make it in bytes.

		CONFIG_OF_LIBFDT

		New kernel versions are expecting firmware settings to be
		passed using flattened device trees (based on open firmware
		concepts).

		CONFIG_OF_LIBFDT
		 * New libfdt-based support
		 * Adds the "fdt" command
		 * The bootm command automatically updates the fdt

		OF_CPU - The proper name of the cpus node (only required for
			MPC512X and MPC5xxx based boards).
		OF_SOC - The proper name of the soc node (only required for
			MPC512X and MPC5xxx based boards).
		OF_TBCLK - The timebase frequency.
		OF_STDOUT_PATH - The path to the console device

		boards with QUICC Engines require OF_QE to set UCC MAC
		addresses

		CONFIG_OF_BOARD_SETUP

		Board code has addition modification that it wants to make
		to the flat device tree before handing it off to the kernel

		CONFIG_OF_BOOT_CPU

		This define fills in the correct boot CPU in the boot
		param header, the default value is zero if undefined.

		CONFIG_OF_IDE_FIXUP

		U-Boot can detect if an IDE device is present or not.
		If not, and this new config option is activated, U-Boot
		removes the ATA node from the DTS before booting Linux,
		so the Linux IDE driver does not probe the device and
		crash. This is needed for buggy hardware (uc101) where
		no pull down resistor is connected to the signal IDE5V_DD7.

		CONFIG_MACH_TYPE	[relevant for ARM only][mandatory]

		This setting is mandatory for all boards that have only one
		machine type and must be used to specify the machine type
		number as it appears in the ARM machine registry
		(see http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/developer/machines/).
		Only boards that have multiple machine types supported
		in a single configuration file and the machine type is
		runtime discoverable, do not have to use this setting.

- vxWorks boot parameters:

		bootvx constructs a valid bootline using the following
		environments variables: bootfile, ipaddr, serverip, hostname.
		It loads the vxWorks image pointed bootfile.

		CONFIG_SYS_VXWORKS_BOOT_DEVICE - The vxworks device name
		CONFIG_SYS_VXWORKS_MAC_PTR - Ethernet 6 byte MA -address
		CONFIG_SYS_VXWORKS_SERVERNAME - Name of the server
		CONFIG_SYS_VXWORKS_BOOT_ADDR - Address of boot parameters

		CONFIG_SYS_VXWORKS_ADD_PARAMS

		Add it at the end of the bootline. E.g "u=username pw=secret"

		Note: If a "bootargs" environment is defined, it will overwride
		the defaults discussed just above.

- Cache Configuration:
		CONFIG_SYS_ICACHE_OFF - Do not enable instruction cache in U-Boot
		CONFIG_SYS_DCACHE_OFF - Do not enable data cache in U-Boot
		CONFIG_SYS_L2CACHE_OFF- Do not enable L2 cache in U-Boot

- Cache Configuration for ARM:
		CONFIG_SYS_L2_PL310 - Enable support for ARM PL310 L2 cache
				      controller
		CONFIG_SYS_PL310_BASE - Physical base address of PL310
					controller register space

- Serial Ports:
		CONFIG_PL010_SERIAL

		Define this if you want support for Amba PrimeCell PL010 UARTs.

		CONFIG_PL011_SERIAL

		Define this if you want support for Amba PrimeCell PL011 UARTs.

		CONFIG_PL011_CLOCK

		If you have Amba PrimeCell PL011 UARTs, set this variable to
		the clock speed of the UARTs.

		CONFIG_PL01x_PORTS

		If you have Amba PrimeCell PL010 or PL011 UARTs on your board,
		define this to a list of base addresses for each (supported)
		port. See e.g. include/configs/versatile.h

		CONFIG_PL011_SERIAL_RLCR

		Some vendor versions of PL011 serial ports (e.g. ST-Ericsson U8500)
		have separate receive and transmit line control registers.  Set
		this variable to initialize the extra register.

		CONFIG_PL011_SERIAL_FLUSH_ON_INIT

		On some platforms (e.g. U8500) U-Boot is loaded by a second stage
		boot loader that has already initialized the UART.  Define this
		variable to flush the UART at init time.


- Console Interface:
		Depending on board, define exactly one serial port
		(like CONFIG_8xx_CONS_SMC1, CONFIG_8xx_CONS_SMC2,
		CONFIG_8xx_CONS_SCC1, ...), or switch off the serial
		console by defining CONFIG_8xx_CONS_NONE

		Note: if CONFIG_8xx_CONS_NONE is defined, the serial
		port routines must be defined elsewhere
		(i.e. serial_init(), serial_getc(), ...)

		CONFIG_CFB_CONSOLE
		Enables console device for a color framebuffer. Needs following
		defines (cf. smiLynxEM, i8042, board/eltec/bab7xx)
			VIDEO_FB_LITTLE_ENDIAN	graphic memory organisation
						(default big endian)
			VIDEO_HW_RECTFILL	graphic chip supports
						rectangle fill
						(cf. smiLynxEM)
			VIDEO_HW_BITBLT		graphic chip supports
						bit-blit (cf. smiLynxEM)
			VIDEO_VISIBLE_COLS	visible pixel columns
						(cols=pitch)

						(i.e. i8042_kbd_init())
			VIDEO_TSTC_FCT		test char fct
						(i.e. i8042_tstc)
			VIDEO_GETC_FCT		get char fct
						(i.e. i8042_getc)
			CONFIG_CONSOLE_CURSOR	cursor drawing on/off
						(requires blink timer
						cf. i8042.c)
			CONFIG_SYS_CONSOLE_BLINK_COUNT blink interval (cf. i8042.c)
			CONFIG_CONSOLE_TIME	display time/date info in
						upper right corner
						(requires CONFIG_CMD_DATE)
			CONFIG_VIDEO_LOGO	display Linux logo in
						upper left corner
			CONFIG_VIDEO_BMP_LOGO	use bmp_logo.h instead of
						linux_logo.h for logo.
						Requires CONFIG_VIDEO_LOGO
			CONFIG_CONSOLE_EXTRA_INFO
						additional board info beside
						the logo

		When CONFIG_CFB_CONSOLE is defined, video console is
		default i/o. Serial console can be forced with
		environment 'console=serial'.

		When CONFIG_SILENT_CONSOLE is defined, all console
		messages (by U-Boot and Linux!) can be silenced with
		the "silent" environment variable. See
		doc/README.silent for more information.

- Console Baudrate:
		CONFIG_BAUDRATE - in bps
		Select one of the baudrates listed in
		CONFIG_SYS_BAUDRATE_TABLE, see below.
		CONFIG_SYS_BRGCLK_PRESCALE, baudrate prescale

- Console Rx buffer length
		With CONFIG_SYS_SMC_RXBUFLEN it is possible to define
		the maximum receive buffer length for the SMC.
		This option is actual only for 82xx and 8xx possible.
		If using CONFIG_SYS_SMC_RXBUFLEN also CONFIG_SYS_MAXIDLE
		must be defined, to setup the maximum idle timeout for
		the SMC.

- Boot Delay:	CONFIG_BOOTDELAY - in seconds
		Delay before automatically booting the default image;
		set to -1 to disable autoboot.

		See doc/README.autoboot for these options that
		work with CONFIG_BOOTDELAY. None are required.
		CONFIG_BOOT_RETRY_TIME
		CONFIG_BOOT_RETRY_MIN
		CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_KEYED
		CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_PROMPT
		CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_DELAY_STR
		CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_STOP_STR
		CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_DELAY_STR2
		CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_STOP_STR2
		CONFIG_ZERO_BOOTDELAY_CHECK
		CONFIG_RESET_TO_RETRY

- Autoboot Command:
		CONFIG_BOOTCOMMAND
		Only needed when CONFIG_BOOTDELAY is enabled;
		define a command string that is automatically executed
		when no character is read on the console interface
		within "Boot Delay" after reset.

		CONFIG_BOOTARGS
		This can be used to pass arguments to the bootm
		command. The value of CONFIG_BOOTARGS goes into the
		environment value "bootargs".

		CONFIG_RAMBOOT and CONFIG_NFSBOOT
		The value of these goes into the environment as
		"ramboot" and "nfsboot" respectively, and can be used
		as a convenience, when switching between booting from
		RAM and NFS.

- Pre-Boot Commands:
		CONFIG_PREBOOT

		When this option is #defined, the existence of the
		environment variable "preboot" will be checked
		immediately before starting the CONFIG_BOOTDELAY
		countdown and/or running the auto-boot command resp.
		entering interactive mode.

		This feature is especially useful when "preboot" is
		automatically generated or modified. For an example
		see the LWMON board specific code: here "preboot" is
		modified when the user holds down a certain
		combination of keys on the (special) keyboard when
		booting the systems

- Serial Download Echo Mode:
		CONFIG_LOADS_ECHO
		If defined to 1, all characters received during a
		serial download (using the "loads" command) are
		echoed back. This might be needed by some terminal
		emulations (like "cu"), but may as well just take
		time on others. This setting #define's the initial
		value of the "loads_echo" environment variable.

- Kgdb Serial Baudrate: (if CONFIG_CMD_KGDB is defined)
		CONFIG_KGDB_BAUDRATE
		Select one of the baudrates listed in
		CONFIG_SYS_BAUDRATE_TABLE, see below.

- Monitor Functions:
		Monitor commands can be included or excluded
		from the build by using the #include files
		"config_cmd_all.h" and #undef'ing unwanted
		commands, or using "config_cmd_default.h"
		and augmenting with additional #define's
		for wanted commands.

		The default command configuration includes all commands
		except those marked below with a "*".

		CONFIG_CMD_ASKENV	* ask for env variable

		EXAMPLE: If you want all functions except of network
		support you can write:

		#include "config_cmd_all.h"
		#undef CONFIG_CMD_NET

	Other Commands:
		fdt (flattened device tree) command: CONFIG_OF_LIBFDT

	Note:	Don't enable the "icache" and "dcache" commands
		(configuration option CONFIG_CMD_CACHE) unless you know
		what you (and your U-Boot users) are doing. Data
		cache cannot be enabled on systems like the 8xx or
		8260 (where accesses to the IMMR region must be
		uncached), and it cannot be disabled on all other
		systems where we (mis-) use the data cache to hold an
		initial stack and some data.


		XXX - this list needs to get updated!

- Watchdog:
		CONFIG_WATCHDOG
		If this variable is defined, it enables watchdog
		support for the SoC. There must be support in the SoC
		specific code for a watchdog. For the 8xx and 8260
		CPUs, the SIU Watchdog feature is enabled in the SYPCR
		register.  When supported for a specific SoC is
		available, then no further board specific code should
		be needed to use it.

		CONFIG_HW_WATCHDOG
		When using a watchdog circuitry external to the used
		SoC, then define this variable and provide board
		specific code for the "hw_watchdog_reset" function.

- U-Boot Version:
		CONFIG_VERSION_VARIABLE
		If this variable is defined, an environment variable
		named "ver" is created by U-Boot showing the U-Boot
		version as printed by the "version" command.
		This variable is readonly.

- Real-Time Clock:

		When CONFIG_CMD_DATE is selected, the type of the RTC
		has to be selected, too. Define exactly one of the
		following options:

		CONFIG_RTC_MPC8xx	- use internal RTC of MPC8xx
		CONFIG_RTC_PCF8563	- use Philips PCF8563 RTC
		CONFIG_RTC_MC13783	- use MC13783 RTC
		CONFIG_RTC_MC146818	- use MC146818 RTC
		CONFIG_RTC_DS1307	- use Maxim, Inc. DS1307 RTC
		CONFIG_RTC_DS1337	- use Maxim, Inc. DS1337 RTC
		CONFIG_RTC_DS1338	- use Maxim, Inc. DS1338 RTC
		CONFIG_RTC_DS164x	- use Dallas DS164x RTC
		CONFIG_RTC_ISL1208	- use Intersil ISL1208 RTC
		CONFIG_RTC_MAX6900	- use Maxim, Inc. MAX6900 RTC
		CONFIG_SYS_RTC_DS1337_NOOSC	- Turn off the OSC output for DS1337
		CONFIG_SYS_RV3029_TCR	- enable trickle charger on
					  RV3029 RTC.

		Note that if the RTC uses I2C, then the I2C interface
		must also be configured. See I2C Support, below.

- GPIO Support:
		CONFIG_PCA953X		- use NXP's PCA953X series I2C GPIO
		CONFIG_PCA953X_INFO	- enable pca953x info command

		The CONFIG_SYS_I2C_PCA953X_WIDTH option specifies a list of
		chip-ngpio pairs that tell the PCA953X driver the number of
		pins supported by a particular chip.

		Note that if the GPIO device uses I2C, then the I2C interface
		must also be configured. See I2C Support, below.

- Timestamp Support:

		When CONFIG_TIMESTAMP is selected, the timestamp
		(date and time) of an image is printed by image
		commands like bootm or iminfo. This option is
		automatically enabled when you select CONFIG_CMD_DATE .

- Partition Support:
		CONFIG_MAC_PARTITION and/or CONFIG_DOS_PARTITION
		and/or CONFIG_ISO_PARTITION and/or CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION

		If IDE or SCSI support is enabled (CONFIG_CMD_IDE or
		CONFIG_CMD_SCSI) you must configure support for at
		least one partition type as well.

- IDE Reset method:
		CONFIG_IDE_RESET_ROUTINE - this is defined in several
		board configurations files but used nowhere!

		CONFIG_IDE_RESET - is this is defined, IDE Reset will
		be performed by calling the function
			ide_set_reset(int reset)
		which has to be defined in a board specific file

- ATAPI Support:
		CONFIG_ATAPI

		Set this to enable ATAPI support.

- LBA48 Support
		CONFIG_LBA48

		Set this to enable support for disks larger than 137GB
		Also look at CONFIG_SYS_64BIT_LBA.
		Whithout these , LBA48 support uses 32bit variables and will 'only'
		support disks up to 2.1TB.

		CONFIG_SYS_64BIT_LBA:
			When enabled, makes the IDE subsystem use 64bit sector addresses.
			Default is 32bit.

- SCSI Support:
		At the moment only there is only support for the
		SYM53C8XX SCSI controller; define
		CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C8XX to enable it.

		CONFIG_SYS_SCSI_MAX_LUN [8], CONFIG_SYS_SCSI_MAX_SCSI_ID [7] and
		CONFIG_SYS_SCSI_MAX_DEVICE [CONFIG_SYS_SCSI_MAX_SCSI_ID *
		CONFIG_SYS_SCSI_MAX_LUN] can be adjusted to define the
		maximum numbers of LUNs, SCSI ID's and target
		devices.
		CONFIG_SYS_SCSI_SYM53C8XX_CCF to fix clock timing (80Mhz)

- NETWORK Support (PCI):
		CONFIG_E1000
		Support for Intel 8254x gigabit chips.

			(some hardware wont work with macros)

		CONFIG_FTGMAC100
		Support for Faraday's FTGMAC100 Gigabit SoC Ethernet

			CONFIG_FTGMAC100_EGIGA
			Define this to use GE link update with gigabit PHY.
			Define this if FTGMAC100 is connected to gigabit PHY.
			If your system has 10/100 PHY only, it might not occur
			wrong behavior. Because PHY usually return timeout or
			useless data when polling gigabit status and gigabit
			control registers. This behavior won't affect the
			correctnessof 10/100 link speed update.

		CONFIG_SMC911X
		Support for SMSC's LAN911x and LAN921x chips

			CONFIG_SMC911X_BASE
			Define this to hold the physical address

			If this option is set, the driver enables cache flush.

- USB Support:
		At the moment only the UHCI host controller is
		supported (PIP405, MIP405, MPC5200); define
		CONFIG_USB_UHCI to enable it.
		define CONFIG_USB_KEYBOARD to enable the USB Keyboard
		and define CONFIG_USB_STORAGE to enable the USB
		storage devices.
		Note:
		Supported are USB Keyboards and USB Floppy drives

				instead of using asynchronous interrupts

- USB Device:
		Define the below if you wish to use the USB console.
		Once firmware is rebuilt from a serial console issue the
		command "setenv stdin usbtty; setenv stdout usbtty" and
		attach your USB cable. The Unix command "dmesg" should print
		it has found a new device. The environment variable usbtty
		can be set to gserial or cdc_acm to enable your device to
		appear to a USB host as a Linux gserial device or a
		Common Device Class Abstract Control Model serial device.
		If you select usbtty = gserial you should be able to enumerate
		a Linux host by
		# modprobe usbserial vendor=0xVendorID product=0xProductID
		else if using cdc_acm, simply setting the environment
		variable usbtty to be cdc_acm should suffice. The following
		might be defined in YourBoardName.h

			CONFIG_USB_DEVICE
			Define this to build a UDC device

			CONFIG_USB_TTY
			Define this to have a tty type of device available to
			talk to the UDC device

			CONFIG_SYS_CONSOLE_IS_IN_ENV
			Define this if you want stdin, stdout &/or stderr to
			be set to usbtty.

			mpc8xx:

				- CONFIG_SYS_USB_EXTC_CLK 0x02

				CONFIG_SYS_USB_BRG_CLK 0xBLAH
				Derive USB clock from brgclk
				- CONFIG_SYS_USB_BRG_CLK 0x04

		If you have a USB-IF assigned VendorID then you may wish to
		define your own vendor specific values either in BoardName.h
		or directly in usbd_vendor_info.h. If you don't define
		CONFIG_USBD_MANUFACTURER, CONFIG_USBD_PRODUCT_NAME,
		CONFIG_USBD_VENDORID and CONFIG_USBD_PRODUCTID, then U-Boot
		should pretend to be a Linux device to it's target host.

			CONFIG_USBD_MANUFACTURER
			Define this string as the name of your company for
			- CONFIG_USBD_MANUFACTURER "my company"

			CONFIG_USBD_PRODUCT_NAME
			Define this string as the name of your product
			- CONFIG_USBD_PRODUCT_NAME "acme usb device"

			CONFIG_USBD_VENDORID

			Implementors Forum. This *must* be a genuine Vendor ID
			to avoid polluting the USB namespace.
			- CONFIG_USBD_VENDORID 0xFFFF

			CONFIG_USBD_PRODUCTID
			Define this as the unique Product ID
			for your device
			- CONFIG_USBD_PRODUCTID 0xFFFF


- MMC Support:
		The MMC controller on the Intel PXA is supported. To
		enable this define CONFIG_MMC. The MMC can be
		accessed from the boot prompt by mapping the device
		to physical memory similar to flash. Command line is
		enabled with CONFIG_CMD_MMC. The MMC driver also works with
		the FAT fs. This is enabled with CONFIG_CMD_FAT.

		CONFIG_SH_MMCIF
		Support for Renesas on-chip MMCIF controller

			CONFIG_SH_MMCIF_ADDR
			Define the base address of MMCIF registers

			CONFIG_SH_MMCIF_CLK
			Define the clock frequency for MMCIF

- Journaling Flash filesystem support:
		CONFIG_JFFS2_NAND, CONFIG_JFFS2_NAND_OFF, CONFIG_JFFS2_NAND_SIZE,
		CONFIG_JFFS2_NAND_DEV
		Define these for a default partition on a NAND device

		CONFIG_SYS_JFFS2_FIRST_SECTOR,
		CONFIG_SYS_JFFS2_FIRST_BANK, CONFIG_SYS_JFFS2_NUM_BANKS
		Define these for a default partition on a NOR device

		CONFIG_SYS_JFFS_CUSTOM_PART
		Define this to create an own partition. You have to provide a
		function struct part_info* jffs2_part_info(int part_num)

		If you define only one JFFS2 partition you may also want to
		#define CONFIG_SYS_JFFS_SINGLE_PART	1
		to disable the command chpart. This is the default when you
		have not defined a custom partition

- Keyboard Support:
		CONFIG_ISA_KEYBOARD

		Define this to enable standard (PC-Style) keyboard
		support

		CONFIG_I8042_KBD
		Standard PC keyboard driver with US (is default) and
		GERMAN key layout (switch via environment 'keymap=de') support.
		Export function i8042_kbd_init, i8042_tstc and i8042_getc
		for cfb_console. Supports cursor blinking.

- Video support:
		CONFIG_VIDEO

		Define this to enable video support (for output to
		video).

		CONFIG_VIDEO_CT69000

		Enable Chips & Technologies 69000 Video chip

		CONFIG_VIDEO_SMI_LYNXEM
		Enable Silicon Motion SMI 712/710/810 Video chip. The
		video output is selected via environment 'videoout'
		(1 = LCD and 2 = CRT). If videoout is undefined, CRT is
		assumed.

		For the CT69000 and SMI_LYNXEM drivers, videomode is
		selected via environment 'videomode'. Two different ways
		are possible:
		- "videomode=num"   'num' is a standard LiLo mode numbers.
		Following standard modes are supported	(* is default):

		      Colors	640x480 800x600 1024x768 1152x864 1280x1024
		-------------+---------------------------------------------
		      8 bits |	0x301*	0x303	 0x305	  0x161	    0x307
		     15 bits |	0x310	0x313	 0x316	  0x162	    0x319
		     16 bits |	0x311	0x314	 0x317	  0x163	    0x31A
		     24 bits |	0x312	0x315	 0x318	    ?	    0x31B
		-------------+---------------------------------------------
		(i.e. setenv videomode 317; saveenv; reset;)

		- "videomode=bootargs" all the video parameters are parsed
		from the bootargs. (See drivers/video/videomodes.c)


		CONFIG_VIDEO_SED13806
		Enable Epson SED13806 driver. This driver supports 8bpp
		and 16bpp modes defined by CONFIG_VIDEO_SED13806_8BPP
		or CONFIG_VIDEO_SED13806_16BPP

		CONFIG_FSL_DIU_FB
		Enable the Freescale DIU video driver.	Reference boards for
		SOCs that have a DIU should define this macro to enable DIU
		support, and should also define these other macros:

			CONFIG_SYS_DIU_ADDR
			CONFIG_VIDEO
			CONFIG_CMD_BMP
			CONFIG_CFB_CONSOLE
			CONFIG_VIDEO_SW_CURSOR
			CONFIG_VGA_AS_SINGLE_DEVICE
			CONFIG_VIDEO_LOGO
			CONFIG_VIDEO_BMP_LOGO

		The DIU driver will look for the 'video-mode' environment
		variable, and if defined, enable the DIU as a console during
		boot.  See the documentation file README.video for a
		description of this variable.

- Keyboard Support:
		CONFIG_KEYBOARD

		Define this to enable a custom keyboard support.
		This simply calls drv_keyboard_init() which must be
		defined in your board-specific files.
		The only board using this so far is RBC823.

- LCD Support:	CONFIG_LCD

		Define this to enable LCD support (for output to LCD
		display); also select one of the supported displays
		by defining one of these:

		CONFIG_ATMEL_LCD:

			HITACHI TX09D70VM1CCA, 3.5", 240x320.

		CONFIG_NEC_NL6448AC33:

			NEC NL6448AC33-18. Active, color, single scan.

		CONFIG_NEC_NL6448BC20

			NEC NL6448BC20-08. 6.5", 640x480.
			Active, color, single scan.

		CONFIG_NEC_NL6448BC33_54

			NEC NL6448BC33-54. 10.4", 640x480.
			Active, color, single scan.

		CONFIG_SHARP_16x9

			Sharp 320x240. Active, color, single scan.
			It isn't 16x9, and I am not sure what it is.

		CONFIG_SHARP_LQ64D341

			Sharp LQ64D341 display, 640x480.
			Active, color, single scan.

		CONFIG_HLD1045

			HLD1045 display, 640x480.
			Active, color, single scan.

		CONFIG_OPTREX_BW

			Optrex	 CBL50840-2 NF-FW 99 22 M5
			or
			Hitachi	 LMG6912RPFC-00T
			or
			Hitachi	 SP14Q002

			320x240. Black & white.

		Normally display is black on white background; define
		CONFIG_SYS_WHITE_ON_BLACK to get it inverted.

- Splash Screen Support: CONFIG_SPLASH_SCREEN

		If this option is set, the environment is checked for
		a variable "splashimage". If found, the usual display
		of logo, copyright and system information on the LCD
		is suppressed and the BMP image at the address
		specified in "splashimage" is loaded instead. The
		console is redirected to the "nulldev", too. This
		allows for a "silent" boot where a splash screen is
		loaded very quickly after power-on.

		CONFIG_SPLASH_SCREEN_ALIGN

		If this option is set the splash image can be freely positioned
		on the screen. Environment variable "splashpos" specifies the
		position as "x,y". If a positive number is given it is used as
		number of pixel from left/top. If a negative number is given it
		is used as number of pixel from right/bottom. You can also
		specify 'm' for centering the image.

		Example:
		setenv splashpos m,m
			=> image at center of screen

		setenv splashpos 30,20
			=> image at x = 30 and y = 20

		setenv splashpos -10,m
			=> vertically centered image
			   at x = dspWidth - bmpWidth - 9

- Gzip compressed BMP image support: CONFIG_VIDEO_BMP_GZIP

		If this option is set, additionally to standard BMP
		images, gzipped BMP images can be displayed via the
		splashscreen support or the bmp command.

- Run length encoded BMP image (RLE8) support: CONFIG_VIDEO_BMP_RLE8

		If this option is set, 8-bit RLE compressed BMP images
		can be displayed via the splashscreen support or the
		bmp command.

- Compression support:
		CONFIG_BZIP2

		If this option is set, support for bzip2 compressed
		images is included. If not, only uncompressed and gzip
		compressed images are supported.

		NOTE: the bzip2 algorithm requires a lot of RAM, so
		the malloc area (as defined by CONFIG_SYS_MALLOC_LEN) should
		be at least 4MB.

		CONFIG_LZMA

		If this option is set, support for lzma compressed
		images is included.

		Note: The LZMA algorithm adds between 2 and 4KB of code and it
		requires an amount of dynamic memory that is given by the
		formula:

			(1846 + 768 << (lc + lp)) * sizeof(uint16)

		Where lc and lp stand for, respectively, Literal context bits
		and Literal pos bits.

		This value is upper-bounded by 14MB in the worst case. Anyway,
		for a ~4MB large kernel image, we have lc=3 and lp=0 for a
		total amount of (1846 + 768 << (3 + 0)) * 2 = ~41KB... that is
		a very small buffer.

		Use the lzmainfo tool to determinate the lc and lp values and
		then calculate the amount of needed dynamic memory (ensuring
		the appropriate CONFIG_SYS_MALLOC_LEN value).

- MII/PHY support:
		CONFIG_PHY_ADDR

		The address of PHY on MII bus.

		CONFIG_PHY_CLOCK_FREQ (ppc4xx)

		The clock frequency of the MII bus

		CONFIG_PHY_GIGE

		If this option is set, support for speed/duplex
		detection of gigabit PHY is included.

		CONFIG_PHY_RESET_DELAY

		Some PHY like Intel LXT971A need extra delay after
		reset before any MII register access is possible.
		For such PHY, set this option to the usec delay
		required. (minimum 300usec for LXT971A)

		CONFIG_PHY_CMD_DELAY (ppc4xx)

		Some PHY like Intel LXT971A need extra delay after
		command issued before MII status register can be read

- Ethernet address:
		CONFIG_ETHADDR
		CONFIG_ETH1ADDR
		CONFIG_ETH2ADDR
		CONFIG_ETH3ADDR
		CONFIG_ETH4ADDR
		CONFIG_ETH5ADDR

		Define a default value for Ethernet address to use
		for the respective Ethernet interface, in case this
		is not determined automatically.

- IP address:
		CONFIG_IPADDR

		Define a default value for the IP address to use for
		the default Ethernet interface, in case this is not
		determined through e.g. bootp.

- Server IP address:
		CONFIG_SERVERIP

		Defines a default value for the IP address of a TFTP
		server to contact when using the "tftboot" command.

		CONFIG_KEEP_SERVERADDR

		Keeps the server's MAC address, in the env 'serveraddr'
		for passing to bootargs (like Linux's netconsole option)

- Multicast TFTP Mode:
		CONFIG_MCAST_TFTP

		Defines whether you want to support multicast TFTP as per
		rfc-2090; for example to work with atftp.  Lets lots of targets
		tftp down the same boot image concurrently.  Note: the Ethernet
		driver in use must provide a function: mcast() to join/leave a
		multicast group.

- BOOTP Recovery Mode:
		CONFIG_BOOTP_RANDOM_DELAY

		If you have many targets in a network that try to
		boot using BOOTP, you may want to avoid that all
		systems send out BOOTP requests at precisely the same
		moment (which would happen for instance at recovery
		from a power failure, when all systems will try to
		boot, thus flooding the BOOTP server. Defining
		CONFIG_BOOTP_RANDOM_DELAY causes a random delay to be
		inserted before sending out BOOTP requests. The
		following delays are inserted then:

		1st BOOTP request:	delay 0 ... 1 sec
		2nd BOOTP request:	delay 0 ... 2 sec
		3rd BOOTP request:	delay 0 ... 4 sec
		4th and following
		BOOTP requests:		delay 0 ... 8 sec

- DHCP Advanced Options:
		You can fine tune the DHCP functionality by defining
		CONFIG_BOOTP_* symbols:

		CONFIG_BOOTP_SUBNETMASK
		CONFIG_BOOTP_GATEWAY
		CONFIG_BOOTP_HOSTNAME
		CONFIG_BOOTP_NISDOMAIN
		CONFIG_BOOTP_BOOTPATH
		CONFIG_BOOTP_BOOTFILESIZE
		CONFIG_BOOTP_DNS
		CONFIG_BOOTP_DNS2
		CONFIG_BOOTP_SEND_HOSTNAME
		CONFIG_BOOTP_NTPSERVER
		CONFIG_BOOTP_TIMEOFFSET
		CONFIG_BOOTP_VENDOREX

		CONFIG_BOOTP_SERVERIP - TFTP server will be the serverip
		environment variable, not the BOOTP server.

		CONFIG_BOOTP_DNS2 - If a DHCP client requests the DNS
		serverip from a DHCP server, it is possible that more
		than one DNS serverip is offered to the client.
		If CONFIG_BOOTP_DNS2 is enabled, the secondary DNS
		serverip will be stored in the additional environment
		variable "dnsip2". The first DNS serverip is always
		stored in the variable "dnsip", when CONFIG_BOOTP_DNS
		is defined.

		CONFIG_BOOTP_SEND_HOSTNAME - Some DHCP servers are capable
		to do a dynamic update of a DNS server. To do this, they
		need the hostname of the DHCP requester.
		If CONFIG_BOOTP_SEND_HOSTNAME is defined, the content
		of the "hostname" environment variable is passed as
		option 12 to the DHCP server.

		CONFIG_BOOTP_DHCP_REQUEST_DELAY

		A 32bit value in microseconds for a delay between
		receiving a "DHCP Offer" and sending the "DHCP Request".
		This fixes a problem with certain DHCP servers that don't
		respond 100% of the time to a "DHCP request". E.g. On an
		AT91RM9200 processor running at 180MHz, this delay needed
		to be *at least* 15,000 usec before a Windows Server 2003
		DHCP server would reply 100% of the time. I recommend at
		least 50,000 usec to be safe. The alternative is to hope
		that one of the retries will be successful but note that
		the DHCP timeout and retry process takes a longer than
		this delay.

 - CDP Options:
		CONFIG_CDP_DEVICE_ID

		The device id used in CDP trigger frames.

		CONFIG_CDP_DEVICE_ID_PREFIX

		A two character string which is prefixed to the MAC address
		of the device.

		CONFIG_CDP_PORT_ID

		A printf format string which contains the ascii name of
		the port. Normally is set to "eth%d" which sets
		eth0 for the first Ethernet, eth1 for the second etc.

		CONFIG_CDP_CAPABILITIES

		A 32bit integer which indicates the device capabilities;
		0x00000010 for a normal host which does not forwards.

		CONFIG_CDP_VERSION

		An ascii string containing the version of the software.

		CONFIG_CDP_PLATFORM

		An ascii string containing the name of the platform.

		CONFIG_CDP_TRIGGER

		A 32bit integer sent on the trigger.

		CONFIG_CDP_POWER_CONSUMPTION

		A 16bit integer containing the power consumption of the
		device in .1 of milliwatts.

		CONFIG_CDP_APPLIANCE_VLAN_TYPE

		A byte containing the id of the VLAN.

- Status LED:	CONFIG_STATUS_LED

		Several configurations allow to display the current
		status using a LED. For instance, the LED will blink
		fast while running U-Boot code, stop blinking as
		soon as a reply to a BOOTP request was received, and
		start blinking slow once the Linux kernel is running
		(supported by a status LED driver in the Linux
		kernel). Defining CONFIG_STATUS_LED enables this
		feature in U-Boot.

- CAN Support:	CONFIG_CAN_DRIVER

		Defining CONFIG_CAN_DRIVER enables CAN driver support
		on those systems that support this (optional)
		feature, like the TQM8xxL modules.

- I2C Support:	CONFIG_HARD_I2C | CONFIG_SOFT_I2C

		These enable I2C serial bus commands. Defining either of
		(but not both of) CONFIG_HARD_I2C or CONFIG_SOFT_I2C will
		include the appropriate I2C driver for the selected CPU.

		This will allow you to use i2c commands at the u-boot
		command line (as long as you set CONFIG_CMD_I2C in
		CONFIG_COMMANDS) and communicate with i2c based realtime
		clock chips. See common/cmd_i2c.c for a description of the
		command line interface.

		CONFIG_HARD_I2C selects a hardware I2C controller.

		CONFIG_SOFT_I2C configures u-boot to use a software (aka
		bit-banging) driver instead of CPM or similar hardware
		support for I2C.

		There are several other quantities that must also be
		defined when you define CONFIG_HARD_I2C or CONFIG_SOFT_I2C.

		In both cases you will need to define CONFIG_SYS_I2C_SPEED
		to be the frequency (in Hz) at which you wish your i2c bus
		to run and CONFIG_SYS_I2C_SLAVE to be the address of this node (ie
		the CPU's i2c node address).

		Now, the u-boot i2c code for the mpc8xx
		(arch/powerpc/cpu/mpc8xx/i2c.c) sets the CPU up as a master node
		and so its address should therefore be cleared to 0 (See,
		eg, MPC823e User's Manual p.16-473). So, set
		CONFIG_SYS_I2C_SLAVE to 0.

		CONFIG_SYS_I2C_INIT_MPC5XXX

		When a board is reset during an i2c bus transfer
		chips might think that the current transfer is still
		in progress.  Reset the slave devices by sending start
		commands until the slave device responds.

		That's all that's required for CONFIG_HARD_I2C.

		If you use the software i2c interface (CONFIG_SOFT_I2C)
		then the following macros need to be defined (examples are
		from include/configs/lwmon.h):

		I2C_INIT

		(Optional). Any commands necessary to enable the I2C
		controller or configure ports.

		eg: #define I2C_INIT (immr->im_cpm.cp_pbdir |=	PB_SCL)

		I2C_PORT

		(Only for MPC8260 CPU). The I/O port to use (the code
		assumes both bits are on the same port). Valid values
		are 0..3 for ports A..D.

		I2C_ACTIVE

		The code necessary to make the I2C data line active
		(driven).  If the data line is open collector, this
		define can be null.

		eg: #define I2C_ACTIVE (immr->im_cpm.cp_pbdir |=  PB_SDA)

		I2C_TRISTATE

		The code necessary to make the I2C data line tri-stated
		(inactive).  If the data line is open collector, this
		define can be null.

		eg: #define I2C_TRISTATE (immr->im_cpm.cp_pbdir &= ~PB_SDA)

		I2C_READ

		Code that returns TRUE if the I2C data line is high,
		FALSE if it is low.

		eg: #define I2C_READ ((immr->im_cpm.cp_pbdat & PB_SDA) != 0)

		I2C_SDA(bit)

		If <bit> is TRUE, sets the I2C data line high. If it
		is FALSE, it clears it (low).

		eg: #define I2C_SDA(bit) \
			if(bit) immr->im_cpm.cp_pbdat |=  PB_SDA; \
			else	immr->im_cpm.cp_pbdat &= ~PB_SDA

		I2C_SCL(bit)

		If <bit> is TRUE, sets the I2C clock line high. If it
		is FALSE, it clears it (low).

		eg: #define I2C_SCL(bit) \
			if(bit) immr->im_cpm.cp_pbdat |=  PB_SCL; \
			else	immr->im_cpm.cp_pbdat &= ~PB_SCL

		I2C_DELAY

		This delay is invoked four times per clock cycle so this
		controls the rate of data transfer.  The data rate thus
		is 1 / (I2C_DELAY * 4). Often defined to be something
		like:

		#define I2C_DELAY  udelay(2)

		CONFIG_SOFT_I2C_GPIO_SCL / CONFIG_SOFT_I2C_GPIO_SDA

		If your arch supports the generic GPIO framework (asm/gpio.h),
		then you may alternatively define the two GPIOs that are to be
		used as SCL / SDA.  Any of the previous I2C_xxx macros will
		have GPIO-based defaults assigned to them as appropriate.

		You should define these to the GPIO value as given directly to
		the generic GPIO functions.

		CONFIG_SYS_I2C_INIT_BOARD

		When a board is reset during an i2c bus transfer
		chips might think that the current transfer is still
		in progress. On some boards it is possible to access
		the i2c SCLK line directly, either by using the
		processor pin as a GPIO or by having a second pin
		connected to the bus. If this option is defined a
		custom i2c_init_board() routine in boards/xxx/board.c
		is run early in the boot sequence.

		CONFIG_SYS_I2C_BOARD_LATE_INIT

		An alternative to CONFIG_SYS_I2C_INIT_BOARD. If this option is
		defined a custom i2c_board_late_init() routine in
		boards/xxx/board.c is run AFTER the operations in i2c_init()
		is completed. This callpoint can be used to unreset i2c bus
		using CPU i2c controller register accesses for CPUs whose i2c
		controller provide such a method. It is called at the end of
		i2c_init() to allow i2c_init operations to setup the i2c bus
		controller on the CPU (e.g. setting bus speed & slave address).

		CONFIG_I2CFAST (PPC405GP|PPC405EP only)

		This option enables configuration of bi_iic_fast[] flags
		in u-boot bd_info structure based on u-boot environment
		variable "i2cfast". (see also i2cfast)

		CONFIG_I2C_MULTI_BUS

		This option allows the use of multiple I2C buses, each of which
		must have a controller.  At any point in time, only one bus is
		active.  To switch to a different bus, use the 'i2c dev' command.
		Note that bus numbering is zero-based.

		CONFIG_SYS_I2C_NOPROBES

		This option specifies a list of I2C devices that will be skipped
		when the 'i2c probe' command is issued.  If CONFIG_I2C_MULTI_BUS
		is set, specify a list of bus-device pairs.  Otherwise, specify
		a 1D array of device addresses

		e.g.
			#undef	CONFIG_I2C_MULTI_BUS
			#define CONFIG_SYS_I2C_NOPROBES	{0x50,0x68}

		will skip addresses 0x50 and 0x68 on a board with one I2C bus

			#define	CONFIG_I2C_MULTI_BUS
			#define CONFIG_SYS_I2C_MULTI_NOPROBES	{{0,0x50},{0,0x68},{1,0x54}}

		will skip addresses 0x50 and 0x68 on bus 0 and address 0x54 on bus 1

		CONFIG_SYS_SPD_BUS_NUM

		If defined, then this indicates the I2C bus number for DDR SPD.
		If not defined, then U-Boot assumes that SPD is on I2C bus 0.

		CONFIG_SYS_RTC_BUS_NUM

		If defined, then this indicates the I2C bus number for the RTC.
		If not defined, then U-Boot assumes that RTC is on I2C bus 0.

		CONFIG_SYS_DTT_BUS_NUM

		If defined, then this indicates the I2C bus number for the DTT.
		If not defined, then U-Boot assumes that DTT is on I2C bus 0.

		CONFIG_SYS_I2C_DTT_ADDR:

		If defined, specifies the I2C address of the DTT device.
		If not defined, then U-Boot uses predefined value for
		specified DTT device.

		CONFIG_FSL_I2C

		Define this option if you want to use Freescale's I2C driver in
		drivers/i2c/fsl_i2c.c.

		CONFIG_I2C_MUX

		Define this option if you have I2C devices reached over 1 .. n
		I2C Muxes like the pca9544a. This option addes a new I2C
		Command "i2c bus [muxtype:muxaddr:muxchannel]" which adds a
		new I2C Bus to the existing I2C Busses. If you select the
		new Bus with "i2c dev", u-bbot sends first the commandos for
		the muxes to activate this new "bus".

		CONFIG_I2C_MULTI_BUS must be also defined, to use this
		feature!

		Example:
		Adding a new I2C Bus reached over 2 pca9544a muxes
			The First mux with address 70 and channel 6
			The Second mux with address 71 and channel 4

		=> i2c bus pca9544a:70:6:pca9544a:71:4

		Use the "i2c bus" command without parameter, to get a list
		of I2C Busses with muxes:

		=> i2c bus
		Busses reached over muxes:
		Bus ID: 2
		  reached over Mux(es):
		    pca9544a@70 ch: 4
		Bus ID: 3
		  reached over Mux(es):
		    pca9544a@70 ch: 6
		    pca9544a@71 ch: 4
		=>

		If you now switch to the new I2C Bus 3 with "i2c dev 3"
		u-boot first sends the command to the mux@70 to enable
		channel 6, and then the command to the mux@71 to enable
		the channel 4.

		After that, you can use the "normal" i2c commands as
		usual to communicate with your I2C devices behind
		the 2 muxes.

		This option is actually implemented for the bitbanging
		algorithm in common/soft_i2c.c and for the Hardware I2C
		Bus on the MPC8260. But it should be not so difficult
		to add this option to other architectures.

		CONFIG_SOFT_I2C_READ_REPEATED_START

		defining this will force the i2c_read() function in
		the soft_i2c driver to perform an I2C repeated start
		between writing the address pointer and reading the
		data.  If this define is omitted the default behaviour
		of doing a stop-start sequence will be used.  Most I2C
		devices can use either method, but some require one or
		the other.

- SPI Support:	CONFIG_SPI

		Enables SPI driver (so far only tested with
		SPI EEPROM, also an instance works with Crystal A/D and
		D/As on the SACSng board)

		CONFIG_SH_SPI

		Enables the driver for SPI controller on SuperH. Currently
		only SH7757 is supported.

		CONFIG_SPI_X

		Enables extended (16-bit) SPI EEPROM addressing.
		(symmetrical to CONFIG_I2C_X)

		CONFIG_SOFT_SPI

		Enables a software (bit-bang) SPI driver rather than
		using hardware support. This is a general purpose
		driver that only requires three general I/O port pins
		(two outputs, one input) to function. If this is
		defined, the board configuration must define several
		SPI configuration items (port pins to use, etc). For
		an example, see include/configs/sacsng.h.

		CONFIG_HARD_SPI

		Enables a hardware SPI driver for general-purpose reads
		and writes.  As with CONFIG_SOFT_SPI, the board configuration
		must define a list of chip-select function pointers.
		Currently supported on some MPC8xxx processors.  For an
		example, see include/configs/mpc8349emds.h.

		CONFIG_MXC_SPI

		Enables the driver for the SPI controllers on i.MX and MXC
		SoCs. Currently only i.MX31 is supported.

- FPGA Support: CONFIG_FPGA

		Enables FPGA subsystem.

		CONFIG_FPGA_<vendor>

		Enables support for specific chip vendors.
		(ALTERA, XILINX)

		CONFIG_FPGA_<family>

		Enables support for FPGA family.
		(SPARTAN2, SPARTAN3, VIRTEX2, CYCLONE2, ACEX1K, ACEX)

		CONFIG_FPGA_COUNT

		Specify the number of FPGA devices to support.

		CONFIG_SYS_FPGA_PROG_FEEDBACK

		Enable printing of hash marks during FPGA configuration.

		CONFIG_SYS_FPGA_CHECK_BUSY

		Enable checks on FPGA configuration interface busy
		status by the configuration function. This option
		will require a board or device specific function to
		be written.

		CONFIG_FPGA_DELAY

		If defined, a function that provides delays in the FPGA
		configuration driver.

		CONFIG_SYS_FPGA_CHECK_CTRLC
		Allow Control-C to interrupt FPGA configuration

		CONFIG_SYS_FPGA_CHECK_ERROR

		Check for configuration errors during FPGA bitfile
		loading. For example, abort during Virtex II
		configuration if the INIT_B line goes low (which
		indicated a CRC error).

		CONFIG_SYS_FPGA_WAIT_INIT

		Maximum time to wait for the INIT_B line to deassert
		after PROB_B has been deasserted during a Virtex II
		FPGA configuration sequence. The default time is 500
		ms.

		CONFIG_SYS_FPGA_WAIT_BUSY

		Maximum time to wait for BUSY to deassert during
		Virtex II FPGA configuration. The default is 5 ms.

		CONFIG_SYS_FPGA_WAIT_CONFIG

		Time to wait after FPGA configuration. The default is
		200 ms.

- Configuration Management:
		CONFIG_IDENT_STRING

		If defined, this string will be added to the U-Boot
		version information (U_BOOT_VERSION)

- Vendor Parameter Protection:

		U-Boot considers the values of the environment
		variables "serial#" (Board Serial Number) and
		"ethaddr" (Ethernet Address) to be parameters that
		are set once by the board vendor / manufacturer, and
		protects these variables from casual modification by
		the user. Once set, these variables are read-only,
		and write or delete attempts are rejected. You can
		change this behaviour:

		If CONFIG_ENV_OVERWRITE is #defined in your config
		file, the write protection for vendor parameters is
		completely disabled. Anybody can change or delete
		these parameters.

		Alternatively, if you #define _both_ CONFIG_ETHADDR
		_and_ CONFIG_OVERWRITE_ETHADDR_ONCE, a default
		Ethernet address is installed in the environment,
		which can be changed exactly ONCE by the user. [The
		serial# is unaffected by this, i. e. it remains
		read-only.]

- Protected RAM:
		CONFIG_PRAM

		Define this variable to enable the reservation of
		"protected RAM", i. e. RAM which is not overwritten
		by U-Boot. Define CONFIG_PRAM to hold the number of
		kB you want to reserve for pRAM. You can overwrite
		this default value by defining an environment
		variable "pram" to the number of kB you want to
		reserve. Note that the board info structure will
		still show the full amount of RAM. If pRAM is
		reserved, a new environment variable "mem" will
		automatically be defined to hold the amount of
		remaining RAM in a form that can be passed as boot
		argument to Linux, for instance like that:

			setenv bootargs ... mem=\${mem}
			saveenv

		This way you can tell Linux not to use this memory,
		either, which results in a memory region that will
		not be affected by reboots.

		*WARNING* If your board configuration uses automatic
		detection of the RAM size, you must make sure that
		this memory test is non-destructive. So far, the
		following board configurations are known to be
		"pRAM-clean":

			ETX094, IVMS8, IVML24, SPD8xx, TQM8xxL,
			HERMES, IP860, RPXlite, LWMON, LANTEC,
			FLAGADM, TQM8260

- Error Recovery:
		CONFIG_PANIC_HANG

		Define this variable to stop the system in case of a
		fatal error, so that you have to reset it manually.
		This is probably NOT a good idea for an embedded
		system where you want the system to reboot
		automatically as fast as possible, but it may be
		useful during development since you can try to debug
		the conditions that lead to the situation.

		CONFIG_NET_RETRY_COUNT

		This variable defines the number of retries for
		network operations like ARP, RARP, TFTP, or BOOTP
		before giving up the operation. If not defined, a
		default value of 5 is used.

		CONFIG_ARP_TIMEOUT

		Timeout waiting for an ARP reply in milliseconds.

- Command Interpreter:
		CONFIG_AUTO_COMPLETE

		Enable auto completion of commands using TAB.

		Note that this feature has NOT been implemented yet
		for the "hush" shell.


		CONFIG_SYS_HUSH_PARSER

		Define this variable to enable the "hush" shell (from
		Busybox) as command line interpreter, thus enabling
		powerful command line syntax like
		if...then...else...fi conditionals or `&&' and '||'
		constructs ("shell scripts").

		If undefined, you get the old, much simpler behaviour
		with a somewhat smaller memory footprint.


		CONFIG_SYS_PROMPT_HUSH_PS2

		This defines the secondary prompt string, which is
		printed when the command interpreter needs more input
		to complete a command. Usually "> ".

	Note:

		In the current implementation, the local variables
		space and global environment variables space are
		separated. Local variables are those you define by
		simply typing `name=value'. To access a local
		variable later on, you have write `$name' or
		`${name}'; to execute the contents of a variable
		directly type `$name' at the command prompt.

		Global environment variables are those you use
		setenv/printenv to work with. To run a command stored
		in such a variable, you need to use the run command,
		and you must not use the '$' sign to access them.

		To store commands and special characters in a
		variable, please use double quotation marks
		surrounding the whole text of the variable, instead
		of the backslashes before semicolons and special
		symbols.

- Commandline Editing and History:
		CONFIG_CMDLINE_EDITING

		Enable editing and History functions for interactive
		commandline input operations

- Default Environment:
		CONFIG_EXTRA_ENV_SETTINGS

		Define this to contain any number of null terminated
		strings (variable = value pairs) that will be part of
		the default environment compiled into the boot image.

		For example, place something like this in your
		board's config file:

		#define CONFIG_EXTRA_ENV_SETTINGS \
			"myvar1=value1\0" \
			"myvar2=value2\0"

		Warning: This method is based on knowledge about the
		internal format how the environment is stored by the
		U-Boot code. This is NOT an official, exported
		interface! Although it is unlikely that this format
		will change soon, there is no guarantee either.
		You better know what you are doing here.

		Note: overly (ab)use of the default environment is
		discouraged. Make sure to check other ways to preset
		the environment like the "source" command or the
		boot command first.

- DataFlash Support:
		CONFIG_HAS_DATAFLASH

		Defining this option enables DataFlash features and
		allows to read/write in Dataflash via the standard
		commands cp, md...

- SystemACE Support:
		CONFIG_SYSTEMACE

		Adding this option adds support for Xilinx SystemACE
		chips attached via some sort of local bus. The address
		of the chip must also be defined in the
		CONFIG_SYS_SYSTEMACE_BASE macro. For example:

		#define CONFIG_SYSTEMACE
		#define CONFIG_SYS_SYSTEMACE_BASE 0xf0000000

		When SystemACE support is added, the "ace" device type
		becomes available to the fat commands, i.e. fatls.

- TFTP Fixed UDP Port:
		CONFIG_TFTP_PORT

		If this is defined, the environment variable tftpsrcp
		is used to supply the TFTP UDP source port value.
		If tftpsrcp isn't defined, the normal pseudo-random port
		number generator is used.

		Also, the environment variable tftpdstp is used to supply
		the TFTP UDP destination port value.  If tftpdstp isn't
		defined, the normal port 69 is used.

		The purpose for tftpsrcp is to allow a TFTP server to
		blindly start the TFTP transfer using the pre-configured
		target IP address and UDP port. This has the effect of
		"punching through" the (Windows XP) firewall, allowing
		the remainder of the TFTP transfer to proceed normally.
		A better solution is to properly configure the firewall,
		but sometimes that is not allowed.

- Show boot progress:
		CONFIG_SHOW_BOOT_PROGRESS

		Defining this option allows to add some board-
		specific code (calling a user-provided function
		"show_boot_progress(int)") that enables you to show
		the system's boot progress on some display (for
		example, some LED's) on your board. At the moment,
		the following checkpoints are implemented:

- Standalone program support:
		CONFIG_STANDALONE_LOAD_ADDR

		This option allows to define board specific values
		for the address where standalone program gets loaded,
		thus overwriting the architecutre dependent default
		settings.

- Frame Buffer Address:
	CONFIG_FB_ADDR

	Define CONFIG_FB_ADDR if you want to use specific address for
	frame buffer.
	Then system will reserve the frame buffer address to defined address
	instead of lcd_setmem (this function grab the memory for frame buffer
	by panel's size).

	Please see board_init_f function.

	If you want this config option then,
	please define it at your board config file

- MTD Support (mtdparts command, UBI support)
		CONFIG_MTD_DEVICE

		Adds the MTD device infrastructure from the Linux kernel.
		Needed for mtdparts command support.

		CONFIG_MTD_PARTITIONS

		Adds the MTD partitioning infrastructure from the Linux
		kernel. Needed for UBI support.

Modem Support:
--------------

[so far only for SMDK2400 boards]

- Modem support enable:
		CONFIG_MODEM_SUPPORT

- RTS/CTS Flow control enable:
		CONFIG_HWFLOW

- Modem debug support:
		CONFIG_MODEM_SUPPORT_DEBUG

		Enables debugging stuff (char screen[1024], dbg())
		for modem support. Useful only with BDI2000.

- Interrupt support (PPC):

		There are common interrupt_init() and timer_interrupt()
		for all PPC archs. interrupt_init() calls interrupt_init_cpu()
		for CPU specific initialization. interrupt_init_cpu()
		should set decrementer_count to appropriate value. If
		CPU resets decrementer automatically after interrupt
		(ppc4xx) it should set decrementer_count to zero.
		timer_interrupt() calls timer_interrupt_cpu() for CPU
		specific handling. If board has watchdog / status_led
		/ other_activity_monitor it works automatically from
		general timer_interrupt().

- General:

		In the target system modem support is enabled when a
		specific key (key combination) is pressed during
		power-on. Otherwise U-Boot will boot normally
		(autoboot). The key_pressed() function is called from
		board_init(). Currently key_pressed() is a dummy
		function, returning 1 and thus enabling modem
		initialization.

		If there are no modem init strings in the
		environment, U-Boot proceed to autoboot; the
		previous output (banner, info printfs) will be
		suppressed, though.

		See also: doc/README.Modem


Configuration Settings:
-----------------------

- CONFIG_SYS_LONGHELP: Defined when you want long help messages included;
		undefine this when you're short of memory.

- CONFIG_SYS_HELP_CMD_WIDTH: Defined when you want to override the default
		width of the commands listed in the 'help' command output.

- CONFIG_SYS_PROMPT:	This is what U-Boot prints on the console to
		prompt for user input.

- CONFIG_SYS_CBSIZE:	Buffer size for input from the Console

- CONFIG_SYS_PBSIZE:	Buffer size for Console output

- CONFIG_SYS_MAXARGS:	max. Number of arguments accepted for monitor commands

- CONFIG_SYS_BARGSIZE: Buffer size for Boot Arguments which are passed to
		the application (usually a Linux kernel) when it is
		booted

- CONFIG_SYS_BAUDRATE_TABLE:
		List of legal baudrate settings for this board.

- CONFIG_SYS_CONSOLE_INFO_QUIET
		Suppress display of console information at boot.

- CONFIG_SYS_CONSOLE_IS_IN_ENV
		If the board specific function
			extern int overwrite_console (void);
		returns 1, the stdin, stderr and stdout are switched to the
		serial port, else the settings in the environment are used.

- CONFIG_SYS_CONSOLE_OVERWRITE_ROUTINE
		Enable the call to overwrite_console().

- CONFIG_SYS_CONSOLE_ENV_OVERWRITE
		Enable overwrite of previous console environment settings.

- CONFIG_SYS_MEMTEST_START, CONFIG_SYS_MEMTEST_END:
		Begin and End addresses of the area used by the
		simple memory test.

- CONFIG_SYS_ALT_MEMTEST:
		Enable an alternate, more extensive memory test.

- CONFIG_SYS_MEMTEST_SCRATCH:
		Scratch address used by the alternate memory test
		You only need to set this if address zero isn't writeable

- CONFIG_SYS_MEM_TOP_HIDE (PPC only):
		If CONFIG_SYS_MEM_TOP_HIDE is defined in the board config header,
		this specified memory area will get subtracted from the top
		(end) of RAM and won't get "touched" at all by U-Boot. By
		fixing up gd->ram_size the Linux kernel should gets passed
		the now "corrected" memory size and won't touch it either.
		This should work for arch/ppc and arch/powerpc. Only Linux
		board ports in arch/powerpc with bootwrapper support that
		recalculate the memory size from the SDRAM controller setup
		will have to get fixed in Linux additionally.

		This option can be used as a workaround for the 440EPx/GRx
		CHIP 11 errata where the last 256 bytes in SDRAM shouldn't
		be touched.

		WARNING: Please make sure that this value is a multiple of
		the Linux page size (normally 4k). If this is not the case,
		then the end address of the Linux memory will be located at a
		non page size aligned address and this could cause major
		problems.

- CONFIG_SYS_TFTP_LOADADDR:
		Default load address for network file downloads

- CONFIG_SYS_LOADS_BAUD_CHANGE:
		Enable temporary baudrate change while serial download

- CONFIG_SYS_SDRAM_BASE:
		Physical start address of SDRAM. _Must_ be 0 here.

- CONFIG_SYS_MBIO_BASE:
		Physical start address of Motherboard I/O (if using a
		Cogent motherboard)

- CONFIG_SYS_FLASH_BASE:
		Physical start address of Flash memory.

- CONFIG_SYS_MONITOR_BASE:
		Physical start address of boot monitor code (set by
		make config files to be same as the text base address
		(CONFIG_SYS_TEXT_BASE) used when linking) - same as
		CONFIG_SYS_FLASH_BASE when booting from flash.

- CONFIG_SYS_MONITOR_LEN:
		Size of memory reserved for monitor code, used to
		determine _at_compile_time_ (!) if the environment is
		embedded within the U-Boot image, or in a separate
		flash sector.

- CONFIG_SYS_MALLOC_LEN:
		Size of DRAM reserved for malloc() use.

- CONFIG_SYS_BOOTM_LEN:
		Normally compressed uImages are limited to an
		uncompressed size of 8 MBytes. If this is not enough,
		you can define CONFIG_SYS_BOOTM_LEN in your board config file
		to adjust this setting to your needs.

- CONFIG_SYS_BOOTMAPSZ:
		Maximum size of memory mapped by the startup code of
		the Linux kernel; all data that must be processed by
		the Linux kernel (bd_info, boot arguments, FDT blob if
		used) must be put below this limit, unless "bootm_low"
		enviroment variable is defined and non-zero. In such case
		all data for the Linux kernel must be between "bootm_low"
		and "bootm_low" + CONFIG_SYS_BOOTMAPSZ.  The environment
		variable "bootm_mapsize" will override the value of
		CONFIG_SYS_BOOTMAPSZ.  If CONFIG_SYS_BOOTMAPSZ is undefined,
		then the value in "bootm_size" will be used instead.

- CONFIG_SYS_BOOT_RAMDISK_HIGH:
		Enable initrd_high functionality.  If defined then the
		initrd_high feature is enabled and the bootm ramdisk subcommand
		is enabled.

- CONFIG_SYS_BOOT_GET_CMDLINE:
		Enables allocating and saving kernel cmdline in space between
		"bootm_low" and "bootm_low" + BOOTMAPSZ.

- CONFIG_SYS_BOOT_GET_KBD:
		Enables allocating and saving a kernel copy of the bd_info in
		space between "bootm_low" and "bootm_low" + BOOTMAPSZ.

- CONFIG_SYS_MAX_FLASH_BANKS:
		Max number of Flash memory banks

- CONFIG_SYS_MAX_FLASH_SECT:
		Max number of sectors on a Flash chip

- CONFIG_SYS_FLASH_ERASE_TOUT:
		Timeout for Flash erase operations (in ms)

- CONFIG_SYS_FLASH_WRITE_TOUT:
		Timeout for Flash write operations (in ms)

- CONFIG_SYS_FLASH_LOCK_TOUT
		Timeout for Flash set sector lock bit operation (in ms)

- CONFIG_SYS_FLASH_UNLOCK_TOUT
		Timeout for Flash clear lock bits operation (in ms)

- CONFIG_SYS_FLASH_PROTECTION
		If defined, hardware flash sectors protection is used
		instead of U-Boot software protection.

- CONFIG_SYS_DIRECT_FLASH_TFTP:

		Enable TFTP transfers directly to flash memory;
		without this option such a download has to be
		performed in two steps: (1) download to RAM, and (2)
		copy from RAM to flash.

		The two-step approach is usually more reliable, since
		you can check if the download worked before you erase
		the flash, but in some situations (when system RAM is
		too limited to allow for a temporary copy of the
		downloaded image) this option may be very useful.

- CONFIG_SYS_FLASH_CFI:
		Define if the flash driver uses extra elements in the
		common flash structure for storing flash geometry.

- CONFIG_FLASH_CFI_DRIVER
		This option also enables the building of the cfi_flash driver
		in the drivers directory

- CONFIG_FLASH_CFI_MTD
		This option enables the building of the cfi_mtd driver
		in the drivers directory. The driver exports CFI flash
		to the MTD layer.

- CONFIG_SYS_FLASH_USE_BUFFER_WRITE
		Use buffered writes to flash.

- CONFIG_FLASH_SPANSION_S29WS_N
		s29ws-n MirrorBit flash has non-standard addresses for buffered
		write commands.

- CONFIG_SYS_FLASH_QUIET_TEST
		If this option is defined, the common CFI flash doesn't
		print it's warning upon not recognized FLASH banks. This
		is useful, if some of the configured banks are only
		optionally available.

- CONFIG_FLASH_SHOW_PROGRESS
		If defined (must be an integer), print out countdown
		digits and dots.  Recommended value: 45 (9..1) for 80
		column displays, 15 (3..1) for 40 column displays.

- CONFIG_SYS_RX_ETH_BUFFER:
		Defines the number of Ethernet receive buffers. On some
		Ethernet controllers it is recommended to set this value
		to 8 or even higher (EEPRO100 or 405 EMAC), since all
		buffers can be full shortly after enabling the interface
		on high Ethernet traffic.
		Defaults to 4 if not defined.

- CONFIG_ENV_MAX_ENTRIES

	Maximum number of entries in the hash table that is used
	internally to store the environment settings. The default
	setting is supposed to be generous and should work in most
	cases. This setting can be used to tune behaviour; see
	lib/hashtable.c for details.

The following definitions that deal with the placement and management
of environment data (variable area); in general, we support the
following configurations:

- CONFIG_BUILD_ENVCRC:

	Builds up envcrc with the target environment so that external utils
	may easily extract it and embed it in final U-Boot images.

- CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_FLASH:

	Define this if the environment is in flash memory.

	a) The environment occupies one whole flash sector, which is
	   "embedded" in the text segment with the U-Boot code. This
	   happens usually with "bottom boot sector" or "top boot
	   sector" type flash chips, which have several smaller
	   sectors at the start or the end. For instance, such a
	   layout can have sector sizes of 8, 2x4, 16, Nx32 kB. In
	   such a case you would place the environment in one of the
	   4 kB sectors - with U-Boot code before and after it. With
	   "top boot sector" type flash chips, you would put the
	   environment in one of the last sectors, leaving a gap
	   between U-Boot and the environment.

	- CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET:

	   Offset of environment data (variable area) to the
	   beginning of flash memory; for instance, with bottom boot
	   type flash chips the second sector can be used: the offset
	   for this sector is given here.

	   CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET is used relative to CONFIG_SYS_FLASH_BASE.

	- CONFIG_ENV_ADDR:

	   This is just another way to specify the start address of
	   the flash sector containing the environment (instead of
	   CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET).

	- CONFIG_ENV_SECT_SIZE:

	   Size of the sector containing the environment.


	b) Sometimes flash chips have few, equal sized, BIG sectors.
	   In such a case you don't want to spend a whole sector for
	   the environment.

	- CONFIG_ENV_SIZE:

	   If you use this in combination with CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_FLASH
	   and CONFIG_ENV_SECT_SIZE, you can specify to use only a part
	   of this flash sector for the environment. This saves
	   memory for the RAM copy of the environment.

	   It may also save flash memory if you decide to use this
	   when your environment is "embedded" within U-Boot code,
	   since then the remainder of the flash sector could be used
	   for U-Boot code. It should be pointed out that this is
	   STRONGLY DISCOURAGED from a robustness point of view:
	   updating the environment in flash makes it always
	   necessary to erase the WHOLE sector. If something goes
	   wrong before the contents has been restored from a copy in
	   RAM, your target system will be dead.

	- CONFIG_ENV_ADDR_REDUND
	  CONFIG_ENV_SIZE_REDUND

	   These settings describe a second storage area used to hold
	   a redundant copy of the environment data, so that there is
	   a valid backup copy in case there is a power failure during
	   a "saveenv" operation.

BE CAREFUL! Any changes to the flash layout, and some changes to the
source code will make it necessary to adapt <board>/u-boot.lds*
accordingly!


- CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_NVRAM:

	Define this if you have some non-volatile memory device
	(NVRAM, battery buffered SRAM) which you want to use for the
	environment.

	- CONFIG_ENV_ADDR:
	- CONFIG_ENV_SIZE:

	  These two #defines are used to determine the memory area you
	  want to use for environment. It is assumed that this memory
	  can just be read and written to, without any special
	  provision.

BE CAREFUL! The first access to the environment happens quite early
in U-Boot initalization (when we try to get the setting of for the
console baudrate). You *MUST* have mapped your NVRAM area then, or
U-Boot will hang.

Please note that even with NVRAM we still use a copy of the
environment in RAM: we could work on NVRAM directly, but we want to
keep settings there always unmodified except somebody uses "saveenv"
to save the current settings.


- CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_EEPROM:

	Use this if you have an EEPROM or similar serial access
	device and a driver for it.

	- CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET:
	- CONFIG_ENV_SIZE:

	  These two #defines specify the offset and size of the
	  environment area within the total memory of your EEPROM.

	- CONFIG_SYS_I2C_EEPROM_ADDR:
	  If defined, specified the chip address of the EEPROM device.
	  The default address is zero.

	- CONFIG_SYS_EEPROM_PAGE_WRITE_BITS:
	  If defined, the number of bits used to address bytes in a
	  single page in the EEPROM device.  A 64 byte page, for example
	  would require six bits.

	- CONFIG_SYS_EEPROM_PAGE_WRITE_DELAY_MS:
	  If defined, the number of milliseconds to delay between
	  page writes.	The default is zero milliseconds.

	- CONFIG_SYS_I2C_EEPROM_ADDR_LEN:
	  The length in bytes of the EEPROM memory array address.  Note
	  that this is NOT the chip address length!

	- CONFIG_SYS_I2C_EEPROM_ADDR_OVERFLOW:
	  EEPROM chips that implement "address overflow" are ones
	  like Catalyst 24WC04/08/16 which has 9/10/11 bits of
	  address and the extra bits end up in the "chip address" bit
	  slots. This makes a 24WC08 (1Kbyte) chip look like four 256
	  byte chips.

	  Note that we consider the length of the address field to
	  still be one byte because the extra address bits are hidden
	  in the chip address.

	- CONFIG_SYS_EEPROM_SIZE:
	  The size in bytes of the EEPROM device.

	- CONFIG_ENV_EEPROM_IS_ON_I2C
	  define this, if you have I2C and SPI activated, and your
	  EEPROM, which holds the environment, is on the I2C bus.

	- CONFIG_I2C_ENV_EEPROM_BUS
	  if you have an Environment on an EEPROM reached over
	  I2C muxes, you can define here, how to reach this
	  EEPROM. For example:

	  #define CONFIG_I2C_ENV_EEPROM_BUS	  "pca9547:70:d\0"

	  EEPROM which holds the environment, is reached over
	  a pca9547 i2c mux with address 0x70, channel 3.

- CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_DATAFLASH:

	Define this if you have a DataFlash memory device which you
	want to use for the environment.

	- CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET:
	- CONFIG_ENV_ADDR:
	- CONFIG_ENV_SIZE:

	  These three #defines specify the offset and size of the
	  environment area within the total memory of your DataFlash placed
	  at the specified address.

- CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_NAND:

	Define this if you have a NAND device which you want to use
	for the environment.

	- CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET:
	- CONFIG_ENV_SIZE:

	  These two #defines specify the offset and size of the environment
	  area within the first NAND device.  CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET must be
	  aligned to an erase block boundary.

	- CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND (optional):

	  This setting describes a second storage area of CONFIG_ENV_SIZE
	  size used to hold a redundant copy of the environment data, so
	  that there is a valid backup copy in case there is a power failure
	  during a "saveenv" operation.  CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_RENDUND must be
	  aligned to an erase block boundary.

	- CONFIG_ENV_RANGE (optional):

	  Specifies the length of the region in which the environment
	  can be written.  This should be a multiple of the NAND device's
	  block size.  Specifying a range with more erase blocks than
	  are needed to hold CONFIG_ENV_SIZE allows bad blocks within
	  the range to be avoided.

	- CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_OOB (optional):

	  Enables support for dynamically retrieving the offset of the
	  environment from block zero's out-of-band data.  The
	  "nand env.oob" command can be used to record this offset.
	  Currently, CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND is not supported when
	  using CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_OOB.

- CONFIG_NAND_ENV_DST

	Defines address in RAM to which the nand_spl code should copy the
	environment. If redundant environment is used, it will be copied to
	CONFIG_NAND_ENV_DST + CONFIG_ENV_SIZE.

- CONFIG_SYS_SPI_INIT_OFFSET

	Defines offset to the initial SPI buffer area in DPRAM. The
	area is used at an early stage (ROM part) if the environment
	is configured to reside in the SPI EEPROM: We need a 520 byte
	scratch DPRAM area. It is used between the two initialization
	calls (spi_init_f() and spi_init_r()). A value of 0xB00 seems
	to be a good choice since it makes it far enough from the
	start of the data area as well as from the stack pointer.

Please note that the environment is read-only until the monitor
has been relocated to RAM and a RAM copy of the environment has been
created; also, when using EEPROM you will have to use getenv_f()
until then to read environment variables.

The environment is protected by a CRC32 checksum. Before the monitor
is relocated into RAM, as a result of a bad CRC you will be working
with the compiled-in default environment - *silently*!!! [This is
necessary, because the first environment variable we need is the
"baudrate" setting for the console - if we have a bad CRC, we don't
have any device yet where we could complain.]

Note: once the monitor has been relocated, then it will complain if
the default environment is used; a new CRC is computed as soon as you
use the "saveenv" command to store a valid environment.

- CONFIG_SYS_FAULT_ECHO_LINK_DOWN:
		Echo the inverted Ethernet link state to the fault LED.

		Note: If this option is active, then CONFIG_SYS_FAULT_MII_ADDR
		      also needs to be defined.

- CONFIG_SYS_FAULT_MII_ADDR:
		MII address of the PHY to check for the Ethernet link state.

- CONFIG_NS16550_MIN_FUNCTIONS:
		Define this if you desire to only have use of the NS16550_init
		and NS16550_putc functions for the serial driver located at
		drivers/serial/ns16550.c.  This option is useful for saving
		space for already greatly restricted images, including but not
		limited to NAND_SPL configurations.

Low Level (hardware related) configuration options:
---------------------------------------------------

- CONFIG_SYS_CACHELINE_SIZE:
		Cache Line Size of the CPU.

- CONFIG_SYS_DEFAULT_IMMR:
		Default address of the IMMR after system reset.

		Needed on some 8260 systems (MPC8260ADS, PQ2FADS-ZU,
		and RPXsuper) to be able to adjust the position of
		the IMMR register after a reset.

- Floppy Disk Support:
		CONFIG_SYS_FDC_DRIVE_NUMBER

		the default drive number (default value 0)

		CONFIG_SYS_ISA_IO_STRIDE

		defines the spacing between FDC chipset registers
		(default value 1)

		CONFIG_SYS_ISA_IO_OFFSET

		defines the offset of register from address. It
		depends on which part of the data bus is connected to
		the FDC chipset. (default value 0)

		If CONFIG_SYS_ISA_IO_STRIDE CONFIG_SYS_ISA_IO_OFFSET and
		CONFIG_SYS_FDC_DRIVE_NUMBER are undefined, they take their
		default value.

		if CONFIG_SYS_FDC_HW_INIT is defined, then the function
		fdc_hw_init() is called at the beginning of the FDC
		setup. fdc_hw_init() must be provided by the board
		source code. It is used to make hardware dependant
		initializations.

- CONFIG_IDE_AHB:
		Most IDE controllers were designed to be connected with PCI
		interface. Only few of them were designed for AHB interface.
		When software is doing ATA command and data transfer to
		IDE devices through IDE-AHB controller, some additional
		registers accessing to these kind of IDE-AHB controller
		is requierd.

- CONFIG_SYS_IMMR:	Physical address of the Internal Memory.
		DO NOT CHANGE unless you know exactly what you're
		doing! (11-4) [MPC8xx/82xx systems only]

- CONFIG_SYS_INIT_RAM_ADDR:

		Start address of memory area that can be used for
		initial data and stack; please note that this must be
		writable memory that is working WITHOUT special
		initialization, i. e. you CANNOT use normal RAM which
		will become available only after programming the
		memory controller and running certain initialization
		sequences.

		U-Boot uses the following memory types:
		- MPC8xx and MPC8260: IMMR (internal memory of the CPU)
		- MPC824X: data cache
		- PPC4xx:  data cache

- CONFIG_SYS_GBL_DATA_OFFSET:

		Offset of the initial data structure in the memory
		area defined by CONFIG_SYS_INIT_RAM_ADDR. Usually
		CONFIG_SYS_GBL_DATA_OFFSET is chosen such that the initial
		data is located at the end of the available space
		(sometimes written as (CONFIG_SYS_INIT_RAM_SIZE -
		CONFIG_SYS_INIT_DATA_SIZE), and the initial stack is just
		below that area (growing from (CONFIG_SYS_INIT_RAM_ADDR +
		CONFIG_SYS_GBL_DATA_OFFSET) downward.

	Note:
		On the MPC824X (or other systems that use the data
		cache for initial memory) the address chosen for
		CONFIG_SYS_INIT_RAM_ADDR is basically arbitrary - it must
		point to an otherwise UNUSED address space between
		the top of RAM and the start of the PCI space.

- CONFIG_FEC[12]_PHY
		Define to the hardcoded PHY address which corresponds

			#define CONFIG_FEC1_PHY 4
		means that the PHY with address 4 is connected to FEC1

		When set to -1, means to probe for first available.

- CONFIG_FEC[12]_PHY_NORXERR
		The PHY does not have a RXERR line (RMII only).

		Note that this is a global option, we can't
		have one FEC in standard MII mode and another in RMII mode.

- CONFIG_CRC32_VERIFY

		Where address/count indicate a memory area
		and crc32 is the correct crc32 which the
		area should have.

- CONFIG_LOOPW
		Add the "loopw" memory command. This only takes effect if
		the memory commands are activated globally (CONFIG_CMD_MEM).

- CONFIG_MX_CYCLIC
		Add the "mdc" and "mwc" memory commands. These are cyclic
		"md/mw" commands.

		This command will print 4 bytes (10,11,12,13) each 500 ms.

		=> mwc.l 100 12345678 10
		This command will write 12345678 to address 100 all 10 ms.

		This only takes effect if the memory commands are activated
		globally (CONFIG_CMD_MEM).

- CONFIG_SKIP_LOWLEVEL_INIT
		[ARM, MIPS only] If this variable is defined, then certain
		low level initializations (like setting up the memory
		controller) are omitted and/or U-Boot does not
		relocate itself into RAM.

		Normally this variable MUST NOT be defined. The only
		exception is when U-Boot is loaded (to RAM) by some
		other boot loader or by a debugger which performs
		these initializations itself.

- CONFIG_SPL_BUILD
		Modifies the behaviour of start.S when compiling a loader
		that is executed before the actual U-Boot. E.g. when
		compiling a NAND SPL.

- CONFIG_USE_ARCH_MEMCPY
  CONFIG_USE_ARCH_MEMSET
		If these options are used a optimized version of memcpy/memset will
		be used if available. These functions may be faster under some
		conditions but may increase the binary size.

Building the Software:
======================

Building U-Boot has been tested in several native build environments
and in many different cross environments. Of course we cannot support
all possibly existing versions of cross development tools in all
(potentially obsolete) versions. In case of tool chain problems we
recommend to use the ELDK (see http://www.denx.de/wiki/DULG/ELDK)
which is extensively used to build and test U-Boot.

If you are not using a native environment, it is assumed that you
have GNU cross compiling tools available in your path. In this case,
you must set the environment variable CROSS_COMPILE in your shell.
Note that no changes to the Makefile or any other source files are
necessary. For example using the ELDK on a 4xx CPU, please enter:

	$ CROSS_COMPILE=ppc_4xx-
	$ export CROSS_COMPILE

Note: If you wish to generate Windows versions of the utilities in
      the tools directory you can use the MinGW toolchain
      (http://www.mingw.org).  Set your HOST tools to the MinGW
      toolchain and execute 'make tools'.  For example:

       $ make HOSTCC=i586-mingw32msvc-gcc HOSTSTRIP=i586-mingw32msvc-strip tools

      Binaries such as tools/mkimage.exe will be created which can
      be executed on computers running Windows.

U-Boot is intended to be simple to build. After installing the
sources you must configure U-Boot for one specific board type. This
is done by typing:

	make NAME_config

where "NAME_config" is the name of one of the existing configu-
rations; see the main Makefile for supported names.

Note: for some board special configuration names may exist; check if
      additional information is available from the board vendor; for
      instance, the TQM823L systems are available without (standard)
      or with LCD support. You can select such additional "features"
      when choosing the configuration, i. e.

      make TQM823L_config
	- will configure for a plain TQM823L, i. e. no LCD support

      make TQM823L_LCD_config
	- will configure for a TQM823L with U-Boot console on LCD

      etc.


Finally, type "make all", and you should get some working U-Boot
images ready for download to / installation on your system:

- "u-boot.bin" is a raw binary image
- "u-boot" is an image in ELF binary format
- "u-boot.srec" is in Motorola S-Record format

By default the build is performed locally and the objects are saved
in the source directory. One of the two methods can be used to change
this behavior and build U-Boot to some external directory:

1. Add O= to the make command line invocations:

	make O=/tmp/build distclean
	make O=/tmp/build NAME_config
	make O=/tmp/build all

2. Set environment variable BUILD_DIR to point to the desired location:

	export BUILD_DIR=/tmp/build
	make distclean
	make NAME_config
	make all

Note that the command line "O=" setting overrides the BUILD_DIR environment
variable.


Please be aware that the Makefiles assume you are using GNU make, so
for instance on NetBSD you might need to use "gmake" instead of
native "make".


If the system board that you have is not listed, then you will need
to port U-Boot to your hardware platform. To do this, follow these
steps:

1.  Add a new configuration option for your board to the toplevel
    "Makefile" and to the "MAKEALL" script, using the existing
    entries as examples. Note that here and at many other places
    boards and other names are listed in alphabetical sort order. Please
    keep this order.
2.  Create a new directory to hold your board specific code. Add any
    files you need. In your board directory, you will need at least
    the "Makefile", a "<board>.c", "flash.c" and "u-boot.lds".
3.  Create a new configuration file "include/configs/<board>.h" for
    your board
3.  If you're porting U-Boot to a new CPU, then also create a new
    directory to hold your CPU specific code. Add any files you need.
4.  Run "make <board>_config" with your new name.
5.  Type "make", and you should get a working "u-boot.srec" file
    to be installed on your target system.
6.  Debug and solve any problems that might arise.
    [Of course, this last step is much harder than it sounds.]


Testing of U-Boot Modifications, Ports to New Hardware, etc.:
==============================================================

If you have modified U-Boot sources (for instance added a new board
or support for new devices, a new CPU, etc.) you are expected to
provide feedback to the other developers. The feedback normally takes
the form of a "patch", i. e. a context diff against a certain (latest
official or latest in the git repository) version of U-Boot sources.

But before you submit such a patch, please verify that your modifi-
cation did not break existing code. At least make sure that *ALL* of
the supported boards compile WITHOUT ANY compiler warnings. To do so,
just run the "MAKEALL" script, which will configure and build U-Boot
for ALL supported system. Be warned, this will take a while. You can
select which (cross) compiler to use by passing a `CROSS_COMPILE'
environment variable to the script, i. e. to use the ELDK cross tools
you can type

	CROSS_COMPILE=ppc_8xx- MAKEALL

or to build on a native PowerPC system you can type

	CROSS_COMPILE=' ' MAKEALL

When using the MAKEALL script, the default behaviour is to build
U-Boot in the source directory. This location can be changed by
setting the BUILD_DIR environment variable. Also, for each target
built, the MAKEALL script saves two log files (<target>.ERR and
<target>.MAKEALL) in the <source dir>/LOG directory. This default
location can be changed by setting the MAKEALL_LOGDIR environment
variable. For example:

	export BUILD_DIR=/tmp/build
	export MAKEALL_LOGDIR=/tmp/log
	CROSS_COMPILE=ppc_8xx- MAKEALL

With the above settings build objects are saved in the /tmp/build,
log files are saved in the /tmp/log and the source tree remains clean
during the whole build process.

Environment Variables:
======================

U-Boot supports user configuration using Environment Variables which
can be made persistent by saving to Flash memory.

Environment Variables are set using "setenv", printed using
"printenv", and saved to Flash using "saveenv". Using "setenv"
without a value can be used to delete a variable from the
environment. As long as you don't save the environment you are
working with an in-memory copy. In case the Flash area containing the
environment is erased by accident, a default environment is provided.

Some configuration options can be set using Environment Variables.

List of environment variables (most likely not complete):

  baudrate	- see CONFIG_BAUDRATE

  bootdelay	- see CONFIG_BOOTDELAY

  bootcmd	- see CONFIG_BOOTCOMMAND

  bootargs	- Boot arguments when booting an RTOS image

  bootfile	- Name of the image to load with TFTP

  bootm_low	- Memory range available for image processing in the bootm
		  command can be restricted. This variable is given as
		  a hexadecimal number and defines lowest address allowed
		  for use by the bootm command. See also "bootm_size"
		  environment variable. Address defined by "bootm_low" is
		  also the base of the initial memory mapping for the Linux
		  kernel -- see the description of CONFIG_SYS_BOOTMAPSZ and
		  bootm_mapsize.

  bootm_mapsize	- Size of the initial memory mapping for the Linux kernel.
		  This variable is given as a hexadecimal number and it
		  defines the size of the memory region starting at base
		  address bootm_low that is accessible by the Linux kernel
		  during early boot.  If unset, CONFIG_SYS_BOOTMAPSZ is used
		  as the default value if it is defined, and bootm_size is
		  used otherwise.

  bootm_size	- Memory range available for image processing in the bootm
		  command can be restricted. This variable is given as
		  a hexadecimal number and defines the size of the region
		  allowed for use by the bootm command. See also "bootm_low"
		  environment variable.

  updatefile	- Location of the software update file on a TFTP server, used
		  by the automatic software update feature. Please refer to
		  documentation in doc/README.update for more details.

  autoload	- if set to "no" (any string beginning with 'n'),
		  "bootp" will just load perform a lookup of the
		  configuration from the BOOTP server, but not try to
		  load any image using TFTP

  autostart	- if set to "yes", an image loaded using the "bootp",
		  "rarpboot", "tftpboot" or "diskboot" commands will
		  be automatically started (by internally calling
		  "bootm")

		  If set to "no", a standalone image passed to the
		  "bootm" command will be copied to the load address
		  (and eventually uncompressed), but NOT be started.
		  This can be used to load and uncompress arbitrary
		  data.

  fdt_high	- if set this restricts the maximum address that the
		  flattened device tree will be copied into upon boot.
		  If this is set to the special value 0xFFFFFFFF then
		  the fdt will not be copied at all on boot.  For this
		  to work it must reside in writable memory, have
		  sufficient padding on the end of it for u-boot to
		  add the information it needs into it, and the memory
		  must be accessible by the kernel.

  i2cfast	- (PPC405GP|PPC405EP only)
		  if set to 'y' configures Linux I2C driver for fast
		  mode (400kHZ). This environment variable is used in
		  initialization code. So, for changes to be effective
		  it must be saved and board must be reset.

  initrd_high	- restrict positioning of initrd images:
		  If this variable is not set, initrd images will be
		  copied to the highest possible address in RAM; this
		  is usually what you want since it allows for
		  maximum initrd size. If for some reason you want to
		  make sure that the initrd image is loaded below the
		  CONFIG_SYS_BOOTMAPSZ limit, you can set this environment
		  variable to a value of "no" or "off" or "0".
		  Alternatively, you can set it to a maximum upper
		  address to use (U-Boot will still check that it
		  does not overwrite the U-Boot stack and data).

		  For instance, when you have a system with 16 MB
		  RAM, and want to reserve 4 MB from use by Linux,
		  you can do this by adding "mem=12M" to the value of
		  the "bootargs" variable. However, now you must make
		  sure that the initrd image is placed in the first
		  12 MB as well - this can be done with

		  setenv initrd_high 00c00000

		  If you set initrd_high to 0xFFFFFFFF, this is an
		  indication to U-Boot that all addresses are legal
		  for the Linux kernel, including addresses in flash
		  memory. In this case U-Boot will NOT COPY the
		  ramdisk at all. This may be useful to reduce the
		  boot time on your system, but requires that this
		  feature is supported by your Linux kernel.

  ipaddr	- IP address; needed for tftpboot command

  loadaddr	- Default load address for commands like "bootp",
		  "rarpboot", "tftpboot", "loadb" or "diskboot"

  loads_echo	- see CONFIG_LOADS_ECHO

  serverip	- TFTP server IP address; needed for tftpboot command

  bootretry	- see CONFIG_BOOT_RETRY_TIME

  bootdelaykey	- see CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_DELAY_STR

  bootstopkey	- see CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_STOP_STR

  ethprime	- When CONFIG_NET_MULTI is enabled controls which
		  interface is used first.

  ethact	- When CONFIG_NET_MULTI is enabled controls which
		  interface is currently active. For example you
		  can do the following

		  => setenv ethact FEC
		  => ping 192.168.0.1 # traffic sent on FEC
		  => setenv ethact SCC
		  => ping 10.0.0.1 # traffic sent on SCC

  ethrotate	- When set to "no" U-Boot does not go through all
		  available network interfaces.
		  It just stays at the currently selected interface.

  netretry	- When set to "no" each network operation will
		  either succeed or fail without retrying.
		  When set to "once" the network operation will
		  fail when all the available network interfaces
		  are tried once without success.
		  Useful on scripts which control the retry operation
		  themselves.

  npe_ucode	- set load address for the NPE microcode

  tftpsrcport	- If this is set, the value is used for TFTP's
		  UDP source port.

  tftpdstport	- If this is set, the value is used for TFTP's UDP
		  destination port instead of the Well Know Port 69.

  tftpblocksize - Block size to use for TFTP transfers; if not set,
		  we use the TFTP server's default block size

  tftptimeout	- Retransmission timeout for TFTP packets (in milli-
		  seconds, minimum value is 1000 = 1 second). Defines
		  when a packet is considered to be lost so it has to
		  be retransmitted. The default is 5000 = 5 seconds.
		  Lowering this value may make downloads succeed
		  faster in networks with high packet loss rates or
		  with unreliable TFTP servers.

  vlan		- When set to a value < 4095 the traffic over
		  Ethernet is encapsulated/received over 802.1q
		  VLAN tagged frames.

The following environment variables may be used and automatically
updated by the network boot commands ("bootp" and "rarpboot"),
depending the information provided by your boot server:

  bootfile	- see above
  dnsip		- IP address of your Domain Name Server
  dnsip2	- IP address of your secondary Domain Name Server
  gatewayip	- IP address of the Gateway (Router) to use
  hostname	- Target hostname
  ipaddr	- see above
  netmask	- Subnet Mask
  rootpath	- Pathname of the root filesystem on the NFS server
  serverip	- see above


There are two special Environment Variables:

  serial#	- contains hardware identification information such
		  as type string and/or serial number
  ethaddr	- Ethernet address

These variables can be set only once (usually during manufacturing of
the board). U-Boot refuses to delete or overwrite these variables
once they have been set once.


Further special Environment Variables:

  ver		- Contains the U-Boot version string as printed
		  with the "version" command. This variable is
		  readonly (see CONFIG_VERSION_VARIABLE).


Please note that changes to some configuration parameters may take
only effect after the next boot (yes, that's just like Windoze :-).


Command Line Parsing:
=====================

There are two different command line parsers available with U-Boot:
the old "simple" one, and the much more powerful "hush" shell:

Old, simple command line parser:
--------------------------------

- supports environment variables (through setenv / saveenv commands)
- several commands on one line, separated by ';'
- variable substitution using "... ${name} ..." syntax
- special characters ('$', ';') can be escaped by prefixing with '\',
  for example:
	setenv bootcmd bootm \${address}
- You can also escape text by enclosing in single apostrophes, for example:
	setenv addip 'setenv bootargs $bootargs ip=$ipaddr:$serverip:$gatewayip:$netmask:$hostname::off'

Hush shell:
-----------

- similar to Bourne shell, with control structures like
  if...then...else...fi, for...do...done; while...do...done,
  until...do...done, ...
- supports environment ("global") variables (through setenv / saveenv
  commands) and local shell variables (through standard shell syntax
  "name=value"); only environment variables can be used with "run"
  command

General rules:
--------------

(1) If a command line (or an environment variable executed by a "run"
    command) contains several commands separated by semicolon, and
    one of these commands fails, then the remaining commands will be
    executed anyway.

(2) If you execute several variables with one call to run (i. e.
    calling run with a list of variables as arguments), any failing
    command will cause "run" to terminate, i. e. the remaining
    variables are not executed.

Note for Redundant Ethernet Interfaces:
=======================================

Some boards come with redundant Ethernet interfaces; U-Boot supports
such configurations and is capable of automatic selection of a
"working" interface when needed. MAC assignment works as follows:

Network interfaces are numbered eth0, eth1, eth2, ... Corresponding
MAC addresses can be stored in the environment as "ethaddr" (=>eth0),
"eth1addr" (=>eth1), "eth2addr", ...

If the network interface stores some valid MAC address (for instance
in SROM), this is used as default address if there is NO correspon-
ding setting in the environment; if the corresponding environment
variable is set, this overrides the settings in the card; that means:

o If the SROM has a valid MAC address, and there is no address in the
  environment, the SROM's address is used.

o If there is no valid address in the SROM, and a definition in the
  environment exists, then the value from the environment variable is
  used.

o If both the SROM and the environment contain a MAC address, and
  both addresses are the same, this MAC address is used.

o If both the SROM and the environment contain a MAC address, and the
  addresses differ, the value from the environment is used and a
  warning is printed.

o If neither SROM nor the environment contain a MAC address, an error
  is raised.

If Ethernet drivers implement the 'write_hwaddr' function, valid MAC addresses
will be programmed into hardware as part of the initialization process.  This
may be skipped by setting the appropriate 'ethmacskip' environment variable.
The naming convention is as follows:
"ethmacskip" (=>eth0), "eth1macskip" (=>eth1) etc.

Image Formats:
==============

U-Boot is capable of booting (and performing other auxiliary operations on)
images in two formats:

New uImage format (FIT)
-----------------------

Flexible and powerful format based on Flattened Image Tree -- FIT (similar
to Flattened Device Tree). It allows the use of images with multiple
components (several kernels, ramdisks, etc.), with contents protected by
SHA1, MD5 or CRC32. More details are found in the doc/uImage.FIT directory.


Old uImage format
-----------------

Old image format is based on binary files which can be basically anything,
preceded by a special header; see the definitions in include/image.h for
details; basically, the header defines the following image properties:

* Target Operating System (Provisions for OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD,
  4.4BSD, Linux, SVR4, Esix, Solaris, Irix, SCO, Dell, NCR, VxWorks,
  LynxOS, pSOS, QNX, RTEMS, INTEGRITY;
  Currently supported: Linux, NetBSD, VxWorks, QNX, RTEMS, LynxOS,
  INTEGRITY).
* Target CPU Architecture (Provisions for Alpha, ARM, AVR32, Intel x86,
  IA64, MIPS, Nios II, PowerPC, IBM S390, SuperH, Sparc, Sparc 64 Bit;
  Currently supported: ARM, AVR32, Intel x86, MIPS, Nios II, PowerPC).
* Compression Type (uncompressed, gzip, bzip2)
* Load Address
* Entry Point
* Image Name
* Image Timestamp

The header is marked by a special Magic Number, and both the header
and the data portions of the image are secured against corruption by
CRC32 checksums.


Linux Support:
==============

Although U-Boot should support any OS or standalone application
easily, the main focus has always been on Linux during the design of
U-Boot.

U-Boot includes many features that so far have been part of some
special "boot loader" code within the Linux kernel. Also, any
"initrd" images to be used are no longer part of one big Linux image;
instead, kernel and "initrd" are separate images. This implementation
serves several purposes:

- the same features can be used for other OS or standalone
  applications (for instance: using compressed images to reduce the
  Flash memory footprint)

- it becomes much easier to port new Linux kernel versions because
  lots of low-level, hardware dependent stuff are done by U-Boot

- the same Linux kernel image can now be used with different "initrd"
  images; of course this also means that different kernel images can
  be run with the same "initrd". This makes testing easier (you don't
  have to build a new "zImage.initrd" Linux image when you just
  change a file in your "initrd"). Also, a field-upgrade of the
  software is easier now.


Linux HOWTO:
============

Porting Linux to U-Boot based systems:
---------------------------------------

U-Boot cannot save you from doing all the necessary modifications to
configure the Linux device drivers for use with your target hardware
(no, we don't intend to provide a full virtual machine interface to
Linux :-).

But now you can ignore ALL boot loader code (in arch/powerpc/mbxboot).

Just make sure your machine specific header file (for instance
include/asm-ppc/tqm8xx.h) includes the same definition of the Board
Information structure as we define in include/asm-<arch>/u-boot.h,
and make sure that your definition of IMAP_ADDR uses the same value
as your U-Boot configuration in CONFIG_SYS_IMMR.


Configuring the Linux kernel:
-----------------------------

No specific requirements for U-Boot. Make sure you have some root
device (initial ramdisk, NFS) for your target system.


Building a Linux Image:
-----------------------

With U-Boot, "normal" build targets like "zImage" or "bzImage" are
not used. If you use recent kernel source, a new build target
"uImage" will exist which automatically builds an image usable by
U-Boot. Most older kernels also have support for a "pImage" target,
which was introduced for our predecessor project PPCBoot and uses a
100% compatible format.

Example:

	make TQM850L_config
	make oldconfig
	make dep
	make uImage

The "uImage" build target uses a special tool (in 'tools/mkimage') to
encapsulate a compressed Linux kernel image with header	 information,
CRC32 checksum etc. for use with U-Boot. This is what we are doing:

* build a standard "vmlinux" kernel image (in ELF binary format):

* convert the kernel into a raw binary image:

	${CROSS_COMPILE}-objcopy -O binary \
				 -R .note -R .comment \
				 -S vmlinux linux.bin

* compress the binary image:

	gzip -9 linux.bin

* package compressed binary image for U-Boot:

	mkimage -A ppc -O linux -T kernel -C gzip \
		-a 0 -e 0 -n "Linux Kernel Image" \
		-d linux.bin.gz uImage


The "mkimage" tool can also be used to create ramdisk images for use
with U-Boot, either separated from the Linux kernel image, or
combined into one file. "mkimage" encapsulates the images with a 64
byte header containing information about target architecture,
operating system, image type, compression method, entry points, time
stamp, CRC32 checksums, etc.

"mkimage" can be called in two ways: to verify existing images and
print the header information, or to build new images.

In the first form (with "-l" option) mkimage lists the information
contained in the header of an existing U-Boot image; this includes
checksum verification:

	tools/mkimage -l image
	  -l ==> list image header information

The second form (with "-d" option) is used to build a U-Boot image
from a "data file" which is used as image payload:

	tools/mkimage -A arch -O os -T type -C comp -a addr -e ep \
		      -n name -d data_file image
	  -A ==> set architecture to 'arch'
	  -O ==> set operating system to 'os'
	  -T ==> set image type to 'type'
	  -C ==> set compression type 'comp'
	  -a ==> set load address to 'addr' (hex)
	  -e ==> set entry point to 'ep' (hex)
	  -n ==> set image name to 'name'
	  -d ==> use image data from 'datafile'

Right now, all Linux kernels for PowerPC systems use the same load
address (0x00000000), but the entry point address depends on the
kernel version:

- 2.2.x kernels have the entry point at 0x0000000C,
- 2.3.x and later kernels have the entry point at 0x00000000.

So a typical call to build a U-Boot image would read:

	-> tools/mkimage -n '2.4.4 kernel for TQM850L' \
	> -A ppc -O linux -T kernel -C gzip -a 0 -e 0 \
	> -d /opt/elsk/ppc_8xx/usr/src/linux-2.4.4/arch/powerpc/coffboot/vmlinux.gz \
	> examples/uImage.TQM850L
	Image Name:   2.4.4 kernel for TQM850L
	Created:      Wed Jul 19 02:34:59 2000
	Image Type:   PowerPC Linux Kernel Image (gzip compressed)
	Data Size:    335725 Bytes = 327.86 kB = 0.32 MB
	Load Address: 0x00000000
	Entry Point:  0x00000000

To verify the contents of the image (or check for corruption):

	-> tools/mkimage -l examples/uImage.TQM850L
	Image Name:   2.4.4 kernel for TQM850L
	Created:      Wed Jul 19 02:34:59 2000
	Image Type:   PowerPC Linux Kernel Image (gzip compressed)
	Data Size:    335725 Bytes = 327.86 kB = 0.32 MB
	Load Address: 0x00000000
	Entry Point:  0x00000000

NOTE: for embedded systems where boot time is critical you can trade
speed for memory and install an UNCOMPRESSED image instead: this
needs more space in Flash, but boots much faster since it does not
need to be uncompressed:

	-> gunzip /opt/elsk/ppc_8xx/usr/src/linux-2.4.4/arch/powerpc/coffboot/vmlinux.gz
	-> tools/mkimage -n '2.4.4 kernel for TQM850L' \
	> -A ppc -O linux -T kernel -C none -a 0 -e 0 \
	> -d /opt/elsk/ppc_8xx/usr/src/linux-2.4.4/arch/powerpc/coffboot/vmlinux \
	> examples/uImage.TQM850L-uncompressed
	Image Name:   2.4.4 kernel for TQM850L
	Created:      Wed Jul 19 02:34:59 2000
	Image Type:   PowerPC Linux Kernel Image (uncompressed)
	Data Size:    792160 Bytes = 773.59 kB = 0.76 MB
	Load Address: 0x00000000
	Entry Point:  0x00000000


Similar you can build U-Boot images from a 'ramdisk.image.gz' file
when your kernel is intended to use an initial ramdisk:

	-> tools/mkimage -n 'Simple Ramdisk Image' \
	> -A ppc -O linux -T ramdisk -C gzip \
	> -d /LinuxPPC/images/SIMPLE-ramdisk.image.gz examples/simple-initrd
	Image Name:   Simple Ramdisk Image
	Created:      Wed Jan 12 14:01:50 2000
	Image Type:   PowerPC Linux RAMDisk Image (gzip compressed)
	Data Size:    566530 Bytes = 553.25 kB = 0.54 MB
	Load Address: 0x00000000
	Entry Point:  0x00000000


Installing a Linux Image:
-------------------------

To downloading a U-Boot image over the serial (console) interface,
you must convert the image to S-Record format:

	objcopy -I binary -O srec examples/image examples/image.srec

The 'objcopy' does not understand the information in the U-Boot
image header, so the resulting S-Record file will be relative to
address 0x00000000. To load it to a given address, you need to
specify the target address as 'offset' parameter with the 'loads'
command.

Example: install the image to address 0x40100000 (which on the
TQM8xxL is in the first Flash bank):

	=> erase 40100000 401FFFFF

	.......... done
	Erased 8 sectors

	=> loads 40100000
	## Ready for S-Record download ...
	~>examples/image.srec
	1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 ...
	...
	15989 15990 15991 15992
	[file transfer complete]
	[connected]
	## Start Addr = 0x00000000


You can check the success of the download using the 'iminfo' command;
this includes a checksum verification so you can be sure no data
corruption happened:

	=> imi 40100000

	## Checking Image at 40100000 ...
	   Image Name:	 2.2.13 for initrd on TQM850L
	   Image Type:	 PowerPC Linux Kernel Image (gzip compressed)
	   Data Size:	 335725 Bytes = 327 kB = 0 MB
	   Load Address: 00000000
	   Entry Point:	 0000000c
	   Verifying Checksum ... OK


Boot Linux:
-----------

The "bootm" command is used to boot an application that is stored in
memory (RAM or Flash). In case of a Linux kernel image, the contents
of the "bootargs" environment variable is passed to the kernel as
parameters. You can check and modify this variable using the
"printenv" and "setenv" commands:


	=> printenv bootargs
	bootargs=root=/dev/ram

	=> setenv bootargs root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=10.0.0.2:/LinuxPPC nfsaddrs=10.0.0.99:10.0.0.2

	=> printenv bootargs
	bootargs=root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=10.0.0.2:/LinuxPPC nfsaddrs=10.0.0.99:10.0.0.2

	=> bootm 40020000

Boot Linux and pass a flat device tree:

titled "Linux Kernel Interface" above for a more in depth explanation. The

More About U-Boot Image Types:
------------------------------

U-Boot supports the following image types:

   "Standalone Programs" are directly runnable in the environment
	provided by U-Boot; it is expected that (if they behave
	well) you can continue to work in U-Boot after return from
	the Standalone Program.
   "OS Kernel Images" are usually images of some Embedded OS which
	will take over control completely. Usually these programs
	will install their own set of exception handlers, device
	drivers, set up the MMU, etc. - this means, that you cannot
	expect to re-enter U-Boot except by resetting the CPU.
   "RAMDisk Images" are more or less just data blocks, and their
	parameters (address, size) are passed to an OS kernel that is
	being started.
   "Multi-File Images" contain several images, typically an OS
	(Linux) kernel image and one or more data images like
	RAMDisks. This construct is useful for instance when you want
	to boot over the network using BOOTP etc., where the boot
	server provides just a single image file, but you want to get
	for instance an OS kernel and a RAMDisk image.

	"Multi-File Images" start with a list of image sizes, each
	image size (in bytes) specified by an "uint32_t" in network
	byte order. This list is terminated by an "(uint32_t)0".
	Immediately after the terminating 0 follow the images, one by
	one, all aligned on "uint32_t" boundaries (size rounded up to
	a multiple of 4 bytes).

   "Firmware Images" are binary images containing firmware (like
	U-Boot or FPGA images) which usually will be programmed to
	flash memory.

   "Script files" are command sequences that will be executed by
	U-Boot's command interpreter; this feature is especially
	useful when you configure U-Boot to use a real shell (hush)
	as command interpreter.


Standalone HOWTO:
=================

One of the features of U-Boot is that you can dynamically load and
run "standalone" applications, which can use some resources of
U-Boot like console I/O functions or interrupt services.

Two simple examples are included with the sources:

"Hello World" Demo:
-------------------

'examples/hello_world.c' contains a small "Hello World" Demo
application; it is automatically compiled when you build U-Boot.
It's configured to run at address 0x00040004, so you can play with it
like that:

	=> loads
	## Ready for S-Record download ...
	~>examples/hello_world.srec
	1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ...
	[file transfer complete]
	[connected]
	## Start Addr = 0x00040004

	=> go 40004 Hello World! This is a test.
	## Starting application at 0x00040004 ...
	Hello World
	argc = 7
	argv[0] = "40004"
	argv[1] = "Hello"
	argv[2] = "World!"
	argv[3] = "This"
	argv[4] = "is"
	argv[5] = "a"
	argv[6] = "test."
	argv[7] = "<NULL>"
	Hit any key to exit ...

	## Application terminated, rc = 0x0

Another example, which demonstrates how to register a CPM interrupt
handler with the U-Boot code, can be found in 'examples/timer.c'.
Here, a CPM timer is set up to generate an interrupt every second.
The interrupt service routine is trivial, just printing a '.'
character, but this is just a demo program. The application can be
controlled by the following keys:

	? - print current values og the CPM Timer registers
	b - enable interrupts and start timer
	e - stop timer and disable interrupts
	q - quit application

	=> loads
	## Ready for S-Record download ...
	~>examples/timer.srec
	1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ...
	[file transfer complete]
	[connected]
	## Start Addr = 0x00040004

	=> go 40004
	## Starting application at 0x00040004 ...

	[q, b, e, ?] ## Application terminated, rc = 0x0


Minicom warning:
================

Over time, many people have reported problems when trying to use the
"minicom" terminal emulation program for serial download. I (wd)
consider minicom to be broken, and recommend not to use it. Under
Unix, I recommend to use C-Kermit for general purpose use (and
especially for kermit binary protocol download ("loadb" command), and
use "cu" for S-Record download ("loads" command).

Nevertheless, if you absolutely want to use it try adding this
configuration to your "File transfer protocols" section:

	   Name	   Program			Name U/D FullScr IO-Red. Multi
	X  kermit  /usr/bin/kermit -i -l %l -s	 Y    U	   Y	   N	  N
	Y  kermit  /usr/bin/kermit -i -l %l -r	 N    D	   Y	   N	  N


NetBSD Notes:
=============

Starting at version 0.9.2, U-Boot supports NetBSD both as host
(build U-Boot) and target system (boots NetBSD/mpc8xx).

Building requires a cross environment; it is known to work on
NetBSD/i386 with the cross-powerpc-netbsd-1.3 package (you will also
need gmake since the Makefiles are not compatible with BSD make).
Note that the cross-powerpc package does not install include files;
attempting to build U-Boot will fail because <machine/ansi.h> is
missing.  This file has to be installed and patched manually:

	# cd /usr/pkg/cross/powerpc-netbsd/include
	# mkdir powerpc
	# ln -s powerpc machine
	# cp /usr/src/sys/arch/powerpc/include/ansi.h powerpc/ansi.h
	# ${EDIT} powerpc/ansi.h	## must remove __va_list, _BSD_VA_LIST

Native builds *don't* work due to incompatibilities between native
and U-Boot include files.

Booting assumes that (the first part of) the image booted is a
stage-2 loader which in turn loads and then invokes the kernel
proper. Loader sources will eventually appear in the NetBSD source
tree (probably in sys/arc/mpc8xx/stand/u-boot_stage2/); in the
meantime, see ftp://ftp.denx.de/pub/u-boot/ppcboot_stage2.tar.gz


Implementation Internals:
=========================

The following is not intended to be a complete description of every
implementation detail. However, it should help to understand the
inner workings of U-Boot and make it easier to port it to custom
hardware.


Initial Stack, Global Data:
---------------------------

The implementation of U-Boot is complicated by the fact that U-Boot
starts running out of ROM (flash memory), usually without access to
system RAM (because the memory controller is not initialized yet).
This means that we don't have writable Data or BSS segments, and BSS
is not initialized as zero. To be able to get a C environment working
at all, we have to allocate at least a minimal stack. Implementation
options for this are defined and restricted by the CPU used: Some CPU
models provide on-chip memory (like the IMMR area on MPC8xx and
MPC826x processors), on others (parts of) the data cache can be
locked as (mis-) used as memory, etc.

	Chris Hallinan posted a good summary of these issues to the
	U-Boot mailing list:

	Subject: RE: [U-Boot-Users] RE: More On Memory Bank x (nothingness)?
	From: "Chris Hallinan" <clh@net1plus.com>

	Correct me if I'm wrong, folks, but the way I understand it
	is this: Using DCACHE as initial RAM for Stack, etc, does not
	require any physical RAM backing up the cache. The cleverness
	is that the cache is being used as a temporary supply of
	necessary storage before the SDRAM controller is setup. It's
	beyond the scope of this list to explain the details, but you
	can see how this works by studying the cache architecture and
	operation in the architecture and processor-specific manuals.

	OCM is On Chip Memory, which I believe the 405GP has 4K. It
	is another option for the system designer to use as an
	initial stack/RAM area prior to SDRAM being available. Either
	option should work for you. Using CS 4 should be fine if your
	board designers haven't used it for something that would
	cause you grief during the initial boot! It is frequently not
	used.

	CONFIG_SYS_INIT_RAM_ADDR should be somewhere that won't interfere
	with your processor/board/system design. The default value
	you will find in any recent u-boot distribution in
	walnut.h should work for you. I'd set it to a value larger
	than your SDRAM module. If you have a 64MB SDRAM module, set
	it above 400_0000. Just make sure your board has no resources
	that are supposed to respond to that address! That code in
	start.S has been around a while and should work as is when
	you get the config right.

It is essential to remember this, since it has some impact on the C
code for the initialization procedures:

* Initialized global data (data segment) is read-only. Do not attempt
  to write it.

* Do not use any uninitialized global data (or implicitely initialized
  as zero data - BSS segment) at all - this is undefined, initiali-
  zation is performed later (when relocating to RAM).

* Stack space is very limited. Avoid big data buffers or things like
  that.

Having only the stack as writable memory limits means we cannot use
normal global data to share information beween the code. But it
turned out that the implementation of U-Boot can be greatly
simplified by making a global data structure (gd_t) available to all
functions. We could pass a pointer to this data as argument to _all_
functions, but this would bloat the code. Instead we use a feature of
the GCC compiler (Global Register Variables) to share the data: we
place a pointer (gd) to the global data into a register which we
reserve for this purpose.

When choosing a register for such a purpose we are restricted by the
relevant  (E)ABI  specifications for the current architecture, and by
GCC's implementation.

For PowerPC, the following registers have specific use:
	R1:	stack pointer
	R2:	reserved for system use
	R3-R4:	parameter passing and return values
	R5-R10: parameter passing
	R13:	small data area pointer
	R30:	GOT pointer
	R31:	frame pointer

	(U-Boot also uses R12 as internal GOT pointer. r12
	is a volatile register so r12 needs to be reset when
	going back and forth between asm and C)

    ==> U-Boot will use R2 to hold a pointer to the global data

    Note: on PPC, we could use a static initializer (since the
    address of the global data structure is known at compile time),
    but it turned out that reserving a register results in somewhat
    smaller code - although the code savings are not that big (on
    average for all boards 752 bytes for the whole U-Boot image,
    624 text + 127 data).

On Blackfin, the normal C ABI (except for P3) is followed as documented here:
	http://docs.blackfin.uclinux.org/doku.php?id=application_binary_interface

    ==> U-Boot will use P3 to hold a pointer to the global data

On ARM, the following registers are used:

	R0:	function argument word/integer result
	R1-R3:	function argument word
	R9:	GOT pointer
	R10:	stack limit (used only if stack checking if enabled)
	R11:	argument (frame) pointer
	R12:	temporary workspace
	R13:	stack pointer
	R14:	link register
	R15:	program counter

    ==> U-Boot will use R8 to hold a pointer to the global data

On Nios II, the ABI is documented here:
	http://www.altera.com/literature/hb/nios2/n2cpu_nii51016.pdf

    ==> U-Boot will use gp to hold a pointer to the global data

    Note: on Nios II, we give "-G0" option to gcc and don't use gp
    to access small data sections, so gp is free.

NOTE: DECLARE_GLOBAL_DATA_PTR must be used with file-global scope,
or current versions of GCC may "optimize" the code too much.

Memory Management:
------------------

U-Boot runs in system state and uses physical addresses, i.e. the
MMU is not used either for address mapping nor for memory protection.

The available memory is mapped to fixed addresses using the memory
controller. In this process, a contiguous block is formed for each
memory type (Flash, SDRAM, SRAM), even when it consists of several
physical memory banks.

U-Boot is installed in the first 128 kB of the first Flash bank (on
TQM8xxL modules this is the range 0x40000000 ... 0x4001FFFF). After
booting and sizing and initializing DRAM, the code relocates itself
to the upper end of DRAM. Immediately below the U-Boot code some
memory is reserved for use by malloc() [see CONFIG_SYS_MALLOC_LEN
configuration setting]. Below that, a structure with global Board
Info data is placed, followed by the stack (growing downward).

Additionally, some exception handler code is copied to the low 8 kB
of DRAM (0x00000000 ... 0x00001FFF).

So a typical memory configuration with 16 MB of DRAM could look like
this:

	0x0000 0000	Exception Vector code
	      :
	0x0000 1FFF
	0x0000 2000	Free for Application Use
	      :
	      :

	      :
	      :
	0x00FB FF20	Monitor Stack (Growing downward)
	0x00FB FFAC	Board Info Data and permanent copy of global data
	0x00FC 0000	Malloc Arena
	      :
	0x00FD FFFF
	0x00FE 0000	RAM Copy of Monitor Code
	...		eventually: LCD or video framebuffer
	...		eventually: pRAM (Protected RAM - unchanged by reset)
	0x00FF FFFF	[End of RAM]


System Initialization:
----------------------

In the reset configuration, U-Boot starts at the reset entry point
(on most PowerPC systems at address 0x00000100). Because of the reset
configuration for CS0# this is a mirror of the onboard Flash memory.
To be able to re-map memory U-Boot then jumps to its link address.
To be able to implement the initialization code in C, a (small!)
initial stack is set up in the internal Dual Ported RAM (in case CPUs
which provide such a feature like MPC8xx or MPC8260), or in a locked
part of the data cache. After that, U-Boot initializes the CPU core,
the caches and the SIU.

Next, all (potentially) available memory banks are mapped using a
preliminary mapping. For example, we put them on 512 MB boundaries
(multiples of 0x20000000: SDRAM on 0x00000000 and 0x20000000, Flash
on 0x40000000 and 0x60000000, SRAM on 0x80000000). Then UPM A is
programmed for SDRAM access. Using the temporary configuration, a
simple memory test is run that determines the size of the SDRAM
banks.

When there is more than one SDRAM bank, and the banks are of
different size, the largest is mapped first. For equal size, the first
bank (CS2#) is mapped first. The first mapping is always for address
0x00000000, with any additional banks following immediately to create
contiguous memory starting from 0.

Then, the monitor installs itself at the upper end of the SDRAM area
and allocates memory for use by malloc() and for the global Board
Info data; also, the exception vector code is copied to the low RAM
pages, and the final stack is set up.

Only after this relocation will you have a "normal" C environment;
until that you are restricted in several ways, mostly because you are
running from ROM, and because the code will have to be relocated to a
new address in RAM.

Coding Standards:
-----------------

All contributions to U-Boot should conform to the Linux kernel
coding style; see the file "Documentation/CodingStyle" and the script
"scripts/Lindent" in your Linux kernel source directory.

Source files originating from a different project (for example the
MTD subsystem) are generally exempt from these guidelines and are not
reformated to ease subsequent migration to newer versions of those
sources.

Please note that U-Boot is implemented in C (and to some small parts in
Assembler); no C++ is used, so please do not use C++ style comments (//)
in your code.

Please also stick to the following formatting rules:
- remove any trailing white space
- use TAB characters for indentation and vertical alignment, not spaces
- make sure NOT to use DOS '\r\n' line feeds
- do not add more than 2 consecutive empty lines to source files
- do not add trailing empty lines to source files

Submissions which do not conform to the standards may be returned
with a request to reformat the changes.


Submitting Patches:
-------------------

Since the number of patches for U-Boot is growing, we need to
establish some rules. Submissions which do not conform to these rules
may be rejected, even when they contain important and valuable stuff.

Please see http://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot/Patches for details.

Patches shall be sent to the u-boot mailing list <u-boot@lists.denx.de>;
see http://lists.denx.de/mailman/listinfo/u-boot

When you send a patch, please include the following information with
it:

* For bug fixes: a description of the bug and how your patch fixes
  this bug. Please try to include a way of demonstrating that the
  patch actually fixes something.

* For new features: a description of the feature and your
  implementation.

* A CHANGELOG entry as plaintext (separate from the patch)

* For major contributions, your entry to the CREDITS file

* When you add support for a new board, don't forget to add this
  board to the MAINTAINERS file, too.

* If your patch adds new configuration options, don't forget to
  document these in the README file.

* The patch itself. If you are using git (which is *strongly*
  recommended) you can easily generate the patch using the
  "git format-patch". If you then use "git send-email" to send it to
  the U-Boot mailing list, you will avoid most of the common problems
  with some other mail clients.

  If you cannot use git, use "diff -purN OLD NEW". If your version of
  diff does not support these options, then get the latest version of
  GNU diff.

  The current directory when running this command shall be the parent
  directory of the U-Boot source tree (i. e. please make sure that
  your patch includes sufficient directory information for the
  affected files).

  We prefer patches as plain text. MIME attachments are discouraged,
  and compressed attachments must not be used.

* If one logical set of modifications affects or creates several
  files, all these changes shall be submitted in a SINGLE patch file.

* Changesets that contain different, unrelated modifications shall be
  submitted as SEPARATE patches, one patch per changeset.


Notes:

* Before sending the patch, run the MAKEALL script on your patched
  source tree and make sure that no errors or warnings are reported
  for any of the boards.

* Keep your modifications to the necessary minimum: A patch
  containing several unrelated changes or arbitrary reformats will be
  returned with a request to re-formatting / split it.

* If you modify existing code, make sure that your new code does not
  add to the memory footprint of the code ;-) Small is beautiful!
  When adding new features, these should compile conditionally only
  (using #ifdef), and the resulting code with the new feature
  disabled must not need more memory than the old code without your
  modification.

* Remember that there is a size limit of 100 kB per message on the
  u-boot mailing list. Bigger patches will be moderated. If they are
  reasonable and not too big, they will be acknowledged. But patches
  bigger than the size limit should be avoided.
