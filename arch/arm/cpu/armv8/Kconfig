	  Say Y here to support "spin-table" enable method for booting Linux.

	  To use this feature, you must do:
	    - Specify enable-method = "spin-table" in each CPU node in the
	      Device Tree you are using to boot the kernel
	    - Let secondary CPUs in U-Boot (in a board specific manner)
	      before the master CPU jumps to the kernel

	  U-Boot automatically does:
	    - Set "cpu-release-addr" property of each CPU node
	      (overwrites it if already exists).
	    - Reserve the code for the spin-table and the release address
	      via a /memreserve/ region in the Device Tree.
