config IMX_RDC
	bool "i.MX Resource domain controller driver"
	depends on ARCH_MX6 || ARCH_MX7
	help
	  i.MX Resource domain controller is used to assign masters
	  and peripherals to differet domains. This can be used to
	  isolate resources.

	depends on ARCH_MX7 || ARCH_MX6 || ARCH_MX7ULP
	help
	  i.MX6/7 supports DCD and Plugin. Enable this configuration
	  to use Plugin, otherwise DCD will be used.

	  This option enables the support for secure boot (HAB).
	  See doc/README.mxc_hab for more details.

config CSF_SIZE
	hex "Maximum size for Command Sequence File (CSF) binary"
	default 0x2060
	help
	  Define the maximum size for Command Sequence File (CSF) binary
	  this information is used to define the image boot data.

config CMD_BMODE
	bool "Support the 'bmode' command"
	default y
	depends on ARCH_MX6 || ARCH_MX5
	help
	  This enables the 'bmode' (bootmode) command for forcing
	  a boot from specific media.

	  This is useful for forcing the ROM's usb downloader to
	  activate upon a watchdog reset which is nice when iterating
	  on U-Boot.  Using the reset button or running bmode normal
	  will set it back to normal.  This command currently
	  supports i.MX53 and i.MX6.

config CMD_DEKBLOB
	bool "Support the 'dek_blob' command"
	help
	  This enables the 'dek_blob' command which is used with the
	  Freescale secure boot mechanism. This command encapsulates and
	  creates a blob of data. See also CMD_BLOB and doc/README.mxc_hab for
	  more information.

config CMD_HDMIDETECT
	bool "Support the 'hdmidet' command"
	help
	  This enables the 'hdmidet' command which detects if an HDMI monitor
	  is connected.

	help
	  Unlike normal 'nand write/erase' commands, this command update
	  Boot Control Block(BCB) for i.MX6 platform NAND IP's.

	  This is similar to kobs-ng, which is used in Linux as separate
	  rootfs package.

config NXP_BOARD_REVISION
	bool "Read NXP board revision from fuses"
	depends on ARCH_MX6 || ARCH_MX7

	  NXP boards based on i.MX6/7 contain the board revision information
	  stored in the fuses. Select this option if you want to be able to
	  retrieve the board revision information.

config DDRMC_VF610_CALIBRATION
	bool "Enable DDRMC (DDR3) on-chip calibration"
	depends on ARCH_VF610
	help
	  Vybrid (vf610) SoC provides some on-chip facility to tune the DDR3
	  memory parameters. Select this option if you want to calculate them
	  at boot time.
	  NOTE:
	  NXP does NOT recommend to perform this calibration at each boot. One
	  shall perform it on a new PCB and then use those values to program
	  the ddrmc_cr_setting on relevant board file.
