	help
	  This option enables the R5 SPL to apply QoS settings for various
	  HW controllers inside the TI K3 SoCs. The files for QoS settings are
	  generated from Sysconfig and k3-resource-partitioning tools.

	help
	  Amount of memory (in bytes) reserved through dynamic allocation at
	  runtime for loading the combined System Firmware and configuration image
	  tree blob. Keep it as tight as possible, as this directly affects the
