config ROCKCHIP_RK3288
	bool "Support Rockchip RK3288"
	help
	  The Rockchip RK3288 is a ARM-based SoC with a quad-core Cortex-A17
	  including NEON and GPU, 1MB L2 cache, Mali-T7 graphics, two
	  video interfaces supporting HDMI and eDP, several DDR3 options
	  and video codec support. Peripherals include Gigabit Ethernet,
	  USB2 host and OTG, SDIO, I2S, UART,s, SPI, I2C and PWMs.

config ROCKCHIP_RK3036
	bool "Support Rockchip RK3036"
	help
	  The Rockchip RK3036 is a ARM-based SoC with a dual-core Cortex-A7
	  including NEON and GPU, Mali-400 graphics, several DDR3 options
	  and video codec support. Peripherals include Gigabit Ethernet,
	  USB2 host and OTG, SDIO, I2S, UART, SPI, I2C and PWMs.

config ROCKCHIP_SPL_HDR
	string "Header of rockchip's spl loader"
	help
	  Rockchip's bootrom requires the spl loader to start with a 4-bytes
	  header. The content of this header depends on the chip type.

config ROCKCHIP_MAX_SPL_SIZE
	hex "Max size of rockchip's spl loader"
	help
	  Different chip may have different sram size. And if we want to jump
	  back to the bootrom after spl, we may need to reserve some sram space
	  for the bootrom.
	  The max spl loader size should be sram size minus reserved
	  size(if needed)
