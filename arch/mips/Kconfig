	  Enable this to include exception vectors in the U-Boot image. This is
	  required if the U-Boot entry point is equal to the address of the
	  CPU reset exception vector (e.g. U-Boot as ROM loader in Qemu,
	  U-Boot booted from parallel NOR flash).
	  Disable this, if the U-Boot image is booted from DRAM (e.g. by SPL).
	  In that case the image size will be reduced by 0x500 bytes.

	help
	  This is the base address for a memory block, which is used for
	  initialising the cache lines. This is also the base address of a memory
	  block which is used for loading and filling cache lines when
	  SYS_MIPS_CACHE_INIT_RAM_LOAD is selected.
	  Normally this is CKSEG0. If the MIPS system needs to move this block
	  to some SRAM or ScratchPad RAM, adapt this option accordingly.

config MIPS_MACH_EARLY_INIT
	bool "Enable mach specific very early init code"
	help
	  Use this to enable the call to mips_mach_early_init() very early
	  from start.S. This function can be used e.g. to do some very early
	  CPU / SoC intitialization or image copying. Its called very early
	  and at this stage the PC might not match the linking address
	  (CONFIG_TEXT_BASE) - no absolute jump done until this call.

config MIPS_CACHE_SETUP
	bool "Allow generic start code to initialize and setup caches"

	help
	  This allows the generic start code to invoke the generic initialization
	  of the CPU caches. Disabling this can be useful for RAM boot scenarios
	  (EJTAG, SPL payload) or for machines which don't need cache initialization
	  or which want to provide their own cache implementation.

	  If unsure, say yes.

config MIPS_CACHE_DISABLE
	bool "Allow generic start code to initially disable caches"
	default n if SKIP_LOWLEVEL_INIT
	default y
	help
	  This allows the generic start code to initially disable the CPU caches
	  and run uncached until the caches are initialized and enabled. Disabling
	  this can be useful on machines which don't need cache initialization or
	  which want to provide their own cache implementation.

	  If unsure, say yes.

config MIPS_RELOCATION_TABLE_SIZE
	hex "Relocation table size"

	---help---
	  A table of relocation data will be appended to the U-Boot binary
	  and parsed in relocate_code() to fix up all offsets in the relocated
	  U-Boot.

	  This option allows the amount of space reserved for the table to be
	  adjusted in a range from 256 up to 64k. The default is 32k and should
	  be ok in most cases. Reduce this value to shrink the size of U-Boot
	  binary.

	  The build will fail and a valid size suggested if this is too small.

	  If unsure, leave at the default value.

config RESTORE_EXCEPTION_VECTOR_BASE
	bool "Restore exception vector base before booting linux kernel"
	help
	  In U-Boot the exception vector base will be moved to top of memory,
	  to be used to display register dump when exception occurs.
	  But some old linux kernel does not honor the base set in CP0_EBASE.
	  A modified exception vector base will cause kernel crash.

	  This option will restore the exception vector base to its previous
	  value.

	  If unsure, say N.

config OVERRIDE_EXCEPTION_VECTOR_BASE

config INIT_STACK_WITHOUT_MALLOC_F
	bool "Do not reserve malloc space on initial stack"
	help
	  Enable this option if you don't want to reserve malloc space on
	  initial stack. This is useful if the initial stack can't hold large
	  malloc space. Platform should set the malloc_base later when DRAM is
	  ready to use.

config SPL_INIT_STACK_WITHOUT_MALLOC_F

	help
	  Enable this option if you don't want to reserve malloc space on
