config TARGET_COREBOOT
	bool "Support coreboot"
	help
	  This target is used for running U-Boot on top of Coreboot. In
	  this case Coreboot does the early inititalisation, and U-Boot
	  takes over once the RAM, video and CPU are fully running.
	  U-Boot is loaded as a fallback payload from Coreboot, in
	  Coreboot terminology. This method was used for the Chromebook
	  Pixel when launched.

config TARGET_CHROMEBOOK_LINK
	bool "Support Chromebook link"
	help
	  This is the Chromebook Pixel released in 2013. It uses an Intel
	  i5 Ivybridge which is a die-shrink of Sandybridge, with 4GB of
	  SDRAM. It has a Panther Point platform controller hub, PCIe
	  WiFi and Bluetooth. It also includes a 720p webcam, USB SD
	  reader, microphone and speakers, display port and 32GB SATA
	  solid state drive. There is a Chrome OS EC connected on LPC,
	  and it provides a 2560x1700 high resolution touch-enabled LCD
	  display.

config HAVE_INTEL_ME
	bool "Platform requires Intel Management Engine"
	help
	  Newer higher-end devices have an Intel Management Engine (ME)
	  which is a very large binary blob (typically 1.5MB) which is
	  required for the platform to work. This enforces a particular
	  SPI flash format. You will need to supply the me.bin file in
	  your board directory.

config X86_RAMTEST
	bool "Perform a simple RAM test after SDRAM initialisation"
	help
	  If there is something wrong with SDRAM then the platform will
	  often crash within U-Boot or the kernel. This option enables a
	  very simple RAM test that quickly checks whether the SDRAM seems
	  to work correctly. It is not exhaustive but can save time by
	  detecting obvious failures.
