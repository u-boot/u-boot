	  Newer higher-end devices have an Intel Management Engine (ME)
	  which is a very large binary blob (typically 1.5MB) which is
	  required for the platform to work. This enforces a particular
	  SPI flash format. You will need to supply the me.bin file in
	  your board directory.

config X86_RAMTEST
	bool "Perform a simple RAM test after SDRAM initialisation"
	help
	  If there is something wrong with SDRAM then the platform will
	  often crash within U-Boot or the kernel. This option enables a
	  very simple RAM test that quickly checks whether the SDRAM seems
	  to work correctly. It is not exhaustive but can save time by
	  detecting obvious failures.

config HAVE_FSP

	  perferred base address specified during the FSP build. Use Intel's
	  Binary Configuration Tool (BCT) to do the rebase.

	  It is a binary blob which U-Boot uses to set up SDRAM.

	  Note: Without this binary U-Boot will not be able to set up its
	  SDRAM so will not boot.

config CACHE_MRC_BIN
	bool
	depends on HAVE_MRC
	default n
	help
	  Enable caching for the memory reference code binary. This uses an
	  MTRR (memory type range register) to turn on caching for the section
	  of SPI flash that contains the memory reference code. This makes
	  SDRAM init run faster.

config CACHE_MRC_SIZE_KB
	int

	default 512
	help
	  Sets the size of the cached area for the memory reference code.
	  This ends at the end of SPI flash (address 0xffffffff) and is

	  of cached space.

config DCACHE_RAM_BASE
	hex
	depends on HAVE_MRC
	help
	  Sets the base of the data cache area in memory space. This is the
	  start address of the cache-as-RAM (CAR) area and the address varies
	  depending on the CPU. Once CAR is set up, read/write memory becomes
	  available at this address and can be used temporarily until SDRAM
	  is working.

config DCACHE_RAM_SIZE
	hex
	depends on HAVE_MRC
	default 0x40000
	help
	  Sets the total size of the data cache area in memory space. This
	  sets the size of the cache-as-RAM (CAR) area. Note that much of the
	  CAR space is required by the MRC. The CAR space available to U-Boot
	  is normally at the start and typically extends to 1/4 or 1/2 of the
	  available size.

config DCACHE_RAM_MRC_VAR_SIZE
	hex
	depends on HAVE_MRC
	help
	  This is the amount of CAR (Cache as RAM) reserved for use by the

	  memory reference code and must be set correctly or the board will
	  not boot.

config HAVE_REFCODE
        bool "Add a Reference Code binary"
        help
          Select this option to add a Reference Code binary to the resulting
          U-Boot image. This is an Intel binary blob that handles system
          initialisation, in this case the PCH and System Agent.

          Note: Without this binary (on platforms that need it such as
          broadwell) U-Boot will be missing some critical setup steps.
          Various peripherals may fail to work.

config SMP
	bool "Enable Symmetric Multiprocessing"
	default n
	help
	  Enable use of more than one CPU in U-Boot and the Operating System
	  when loaded. Each CPU will be started up and information can be
	  obtained using the 'cpu' command. If this option is disabled, then
	  only one CPU will be enabled regardless of the number of CPUs
	  available.

config MAX_CPUS
	int "Maximum number of CPUs permitted"
	depends on SMP
	default 4
	help
	  When using multi-CPU chips it is possible for U-Boot to start up
	  more than one CPU. The stack memory used by all of these CPUs is
	  pre-allocated so at present U-Boot wants to know the maximum
	  number of CPUs that may be present. Set this to at least as high
	  as the number of CPUs in your system (it uses about 4KB of RAM for
	  each CPU).

config AP_STACK_SIZE
	hex
	depends on SMP
	default 0x1000
	help
	  Each additional CPU started by U-Boot requires its own stack. This
	  option sets the stack size used by each CPU and directly affects
	  the memory used by this initialisation process. Typically 4KB is
	  enough space.

config HAVE_VGA_BIOS

	  Select this option if you have a VGA BIOS image that you would
	  like to add to your ROM.

config VGA_BIOS_FILE

	default 0xfff90000
	help
	  The location of VGA BIOS image in the SPI flash. For example, base

config GENERATE_PIRQ_TABLE
	bool "Generate a PIRQ table"
	default n
	help
	  Generate a PIRQ routing table for this board. The PIRQ routing table
	  is generated by U-Boot in the system memory from 0xf0000 to 0xfffff
	  at every 16-byte boundary with a PCI IRQ routing signature ("$PIR").
	  It specifies the interrupt router information as well how all the PCI
	  devices' interrupt pins are wired to PIRQs.

config GENERATE_SFI_TABLE
	bool "Generate a SFI (Simple Firmware Interface) table"
	help
	  The Simple Firmware Interface (SFI) provides a lightweight method
	  for platform firmware to pass information to the operating system
	  via static tables in memory.  Kernel SFI support is required to
	  boot on SFI-only platforms.  If you have ACPI tables then these are
	  used instead.

	  U-Boot writes this table in write_sfi_table() just before booting
	  the OS.

	  For more information, see http://simplefirmware.org

config GENERATE_MP_TABLE
	bool "Generate an MP (Multi-Processor) table"
	default n
	help
	  Generate an MP (Multi-Processor) table for this board. The MP table
	  provides a way for the operating system to support for symmetric
	  multiprocessing as well as symmetric I/O interrupt handling with
	  the local APIC and I/O APIC.

config GENERATE_ACPI_TABLE
	bool "Generate an ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) table"
	default n
	help
	  The Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) specification
	  provides an open standard for device configuration and management
	  by the operating system. It defines platform-independent interfaces
	  for configuration and power management monitoring.

config QEMU_ACPI_TABLE
	bool "Load ACPI table from QEMU fw_cfg interface"
	depends on GENERATE_ACPI_TABLE && QEMU
	default y
	help
	  By default, U-Boot generates its own ACPI tables. This option, if
	  enabled, disables U-Boot's version and loads ACPI tables generated
	  by QEMU.

config GENERATE_SMBIOS_TABLE
	bool "Generate an SMBIOS (System Management BIOS) table"
	default y
	help
	  The System Management BIOS (SMBIOS) specification addresses how
	  motherboard and system vendors present management information about
	  their products in a standard format by extending the BIOS interface
	  on Intel architecture systems.

config MAX_PIRQ_LINKS
	int
	default 8
	help
	  This variable specifies the number of PIRQ interrupt links which are

	  Some newer chipsets offer more than four links, commonly up to PIRQH.

config IRQ_SLOT_COUNT
	int
	default 128
	help
	  U-Boot can support up to 254 IRQ slot info in the PIRQ routing table
	  which in turns forms a table of exact 4KiB. The default value 128

	  change it according to your needs.

config PCIE_ECAM_BASE
	hex
	default 0xe0000000
	help
	  This is the memory-mapped address of PCI configuration space, which
	  is only available through the Enhanced Configuration Access
	  Mechanism (ECAM) with PCI Express. It can be set up almost
	  anywhere. Before it is set up, it is possible to access PCI
	  configuration space through I/O access, but memory access is more
	  convenient. Using this, PCI can be scanned and configured. This
	  should be set to a region that does not conflict with memory
	  assigned to PCI devices - i.e. the memory and prefetch regions, as
	  passed to pci_set_region().

config PCIE_ECAM_SIZE
	hex
	default 0x10000000
	help
	  This is the size of memory-mapped address of PCI configuration space,
	  which is only available through the Enhanced Configuration Access
	  Mechanism (ECAM) with PCI Express. Each bus consumes 1 MiB memory,
	  so a default 0x10000000 size covers all of the 256 buses which is the
	  maximum number of PCI buses as defined by the PCI specification.
