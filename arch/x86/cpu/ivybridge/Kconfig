          Select this option to add a System Agent binary to
          the resulting U-Boot image. MRC stands for Memory Reference Code.
          It is a binary blob which U-Boot uses to set up SDRAM.

          Note: Without this binary U-Boot will not be able to set up its
          SDRAM so will not boot.

	help
	  This is the amount of CAR (Cache as RAM) reserved for use by the
	  memory reference code. This should be set to 16KB (0x4000 hex)
	  so that MRC has enough space to run.

	help
	  Virtual Machine Extensions are provided in many x86 CPUs. These
	  provide various facilities for allowing a host OS to provide an
	  environment where potentially several guest OSes have only
	  limited access to the underlying hardware. This is achieved
	  without resorting to software trapping and/or instruction set
	  emulation (which would be very slow).

	  Intel's implementation of this is called VT-x. This option enables
	  VT-x this so that the OS that is booted by U-Boot can make use of
	  these facilities. If this option is not enabled, then the host OS
	  will be unable to support virtualisation, or it will run very
	  slowly.
