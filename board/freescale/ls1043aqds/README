Overview
--------
The LS1043A Development System (QDS) is a high-performance computing,
evaluation, and development platform that supports the QorIQ LS1043A
LayerScape Architecture processor. The LS1043AQDS provides SW development
platform for the Freescale LS1043A processor series, with a complete
debugging environment.
