Qemu is a full system emulator. See

http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu

Limitations & comments
----------------------
Supports the "-m mips" configuration of qemu: serial,NE2000,IDE.
Support is big endian only for now (or at least this is what I tested).
Derived from au1x00 with a lot of things cut out.

Supports emulated flash (patch Jean-Christophe PLAGNIOL-VILLARD) with
recent qemu versions. When using emulated flash, launch with
-pflash <filename> and erase mips_bios.bin.
