	help
	  This option allows you to boot the new uImage structure,
	  Flattened Image Tree.  FIT is formally a FDT, which can include
	  images of various types (kernel, FDT blob, ramdisk, etc.)
	  in a single blob.  To boot this new uImage structure,
	  pass the address of the blob to the "bootm" command.
	  FIT is very flexible, supporting compression, multiple images,
	  multiple configurations, verification through hashing and also
	  verified boot (secure boot using RSA).

config TIMESTAMP

	default y if CMD_DATE
	help
	  When CONFIG_TIMESTAMP is selected, the timestamp (date and time) of
	  an image is printed by image commands like bootm or iminfo. This
	  is shown as 'Timestamp: xxx' and 'Created: xxx'. If this option is
	  enabled, then U-Boot requires FITs to have a timestamp. If a FIT is
	  loaded that does not, the message 'Wrong FIT format: no timestamp'

	  Stash the bootstage information in the FDT. A root 'bootstage'

	  has a 'name' property and either 'mark' containing the
	  mark time in microseconds, or 'accum' containing the
	  accumulated time for that bootstage id in microseconds.
	  For example:

		bootstage {

	bool "Support substituting strings in boot arguments"
	help
	  This allows substituting string values in the boot arguments. These
	  are applied after the commandline has been built.

	  One use for this is to insert the root-disk UUID into the command
	  line where bootargs contains "root=${uuid}"

		setenv bootargs "console= root=${uuid}"
		# Set the 'uuid' environment variable
		part uuid mmc 2:2 uuid

		# Command-line substitution will put the real uuid into the
		# kernel command line
		bootm

config USE_BOOTCOMMAND
	bool "Enable a default value for bootcmd"
	help
	  Provide a default value for the bootcmd entry in the environment.  If
	  autoboot is enabled this is what will be run automatically.  Enable
	  this option to be able to specify CONFIG_BOOTCOMMAND as a string.  If
	  this option is disabled, CONFIG_BOOTCOMMAND will be undefined and
	  won't take any space in U-Boot image.

config BOOTCOMMAND
	string "bootcmd value"
	depends on USE_BOOTCOMMAND && !USE_DEFAULT_ENV_FILE
	default "bootflow scan -lb" if BOOTSTD_BOOTCOMMAND && CMD_BOOTFLOW_FULL
	default "bootflow scan" if BOOTSTD_BOOTCOMMAND && !CMD_BOOTFLOW_FULL
	default "run distro_bootcmd" if !BOOTSTD_BOOTCOMMAND && DISTRO_DEFAULTS
	help
	  This is the string of commands that will be used as bootcmd and if
	  AUTOBOOT is set, automatically run.

config USE_PREBOOT
	bool "Enable preboot"
	help
	  When this option is enabled, the existence of the environment
	  variable "preboot" will be checked immediately before starting the
	  CONFIG_BOOTDELAY countdown and/or running the auto-boot command resp.
	  entering interactive mode.

	  This feature is especially useful when "preboot" is automatically
	  generated or modified. For example, the boot code can modify the
	  "preboot" when a user holds down a certain combination of keys.

config PREBOOT
	string "preboot default value"
	depends on USE_PREBOOT && !USE_DEFAULT_ENV_FILE
	default "usb start" if USB_KEYBOARD
	default ""
	help
	  This is the default of "preboot" environment variable.

config DEFAULT_FDT_FILE
	string "Default fdt file"
	help
	  This option is used to set the default fdt file to boot OS.

config SAVE_PREV_BL_FDT_ADDR
	depends on ARM
	bool "Saves fdt address, passed by the previous bootloader, to env var"
	help
	  When u-boot is used as a chain-loaded bootloader (replacing OS kernel),
	  enable this option to save fdt address, passed by the
	  previous bootloader for future use.
	  Address is saved to `prevbl_fdt_addr` environment variable.

	  If no fdt was provided by previous bootloader, no env variables
	  will be created.

config SAVE_PREV_BL_INITRAMFS_START_ADDR
	depends on ARM
	bool "Saves initramfs address, passed by the previous bootloader, to env var"
	help
	  When u-boot is used as a chain-loaded bootloader(replacing OS kernel),
	  enable this option to save initramfs address, passed by the
	  previous bootloader for future use.
	  Address is saved to `prevbl_initrd_start_addr` environment variable.

	  If no initramfs was provided by previous bootloader, no env variables
	  will be created.
