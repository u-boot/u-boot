	  When CONFIG_TIMESTAMP is selected, the timestamp (date and time) of
	  an image is printed by image commands like bootm or iminfo. This
	  is shown as 'Timestamp: xxx' and 'Created: xxx'. If this option is

	  For many embedded devices it's useful to enter a special flashing mode
	  such as fastboot mode when a button is held during boot. This option
	  allows arbitrary commands to be assigned to specific buttons. These will
	  be run after "preboot" if the button is held. Configuration is done via
	  the environment variables "button_cmd_N_name" and "button_cmd_N" where n is
	  the button number (starting from 0). e.g:

	    "button_cmd_0_name=vol_down"

	  Flattened Image Tree.  FIT is formally a FDT, which can include
	  images of various types (kernel, FDT blob, ramdisk, etc.)
	  in a single blob.  To boot this new uImage structure,
	  pass the address of the blob to the "bootm" command.
	  FIT is very flexible, supporting compression, multiple images,
	  multiple configurations, verification through hashing and also
	  verified boot (secure boot using RSA).

	  Normally, IDs are defined in bootstage.h but a small number of

	int "delay in seconds before automatically booting"
	default 2
	help
	  Delay before automatically running bootcmd;
	  set to 0 to autoboot with no delay, but you can stop it by key input.
	  set to -1 to disable autoboot.
	  set to -2 to autoboot with no delay and not check for abort

	  If this value is >= 0 then it is also used for the default delay
	  before starting the default entry in bootmenu. If it is < 0 then
	  a default value of 10s is used.

	  See doc/README.autoboot for details.

config AUTOBOOT_KEYED
	bool "Stop autobooting via specific input key / string"
	help
	  This option enables stopping (aborting) of the automatic
	  boot feature only by issuing a specific input key or
	  string. If not enabled, any input key will abort the
	  U-Boot automatic booting process and bring the device
	  to the U-Boot prompt for user input.

config AUTOBOOT_FLUSH_STDIN
	bool "Enable flushing stdin before starting to read the password"
	depends on !SANDBOX
	help
	  When this option is enabled stdin buffer will be flushed before
	  starting to read the password.
	  This can't be enabled for the sandbox as flushing stdin would
	  break the autoboot unit tests.

config AUTOBOOT_PROMPT
	string "Autoboot stop prompt"
	default "Autoboot in %d seconds\\n"
	help
	  This string is displayed before the boot delay selected by
	  CONFIG_BOOTDELAY starts. If it is not defined	there is no
	  output indicating that autoboot is in progress.

	  Note that this define is used as the (only) argument to a
	  printf() call, so it may contain '%' format specifications,
	  provided that it also includes, separated by commas exactly
	  like in a printf statement, the required arguments. It is
	  the responsibility of the user to select only such arguments
	  that are valid in the given context.

config AUTOBOOT_ENCRYPTION
	bool "Enable encryption in autoboot stopping"
	help
	  This option allows a string to be entered into U-Boot to stop the
	  autoboot.
	  The behavior depends whether CONFIG_CRYPT_PW from lib is enabled
	  or not.
	  In case CONFIG_CRYPT_PW is enabled, the string will be forwarded
	  to the crypt-based functionality and be compared against the
	  string in the environment variable 'bootstopkeycrypt'.
	  In case CONFIG_CRYPT_PW is disabled the string itself is hashed
	  and compared against the hash in the environment variable
	  'bootstopkeysha256'.
	  If it matches in either case then boot stops and
	  a command-line prompt is presented.
	  This provides a way to ship a secure production device which can also
	  be accessed at the U-Boot command line.

config AUTOBOOT_SHA256_FALLBACK
	bool "Allow fallback from crypt-hashed password to sha256"
	depends on AUTOBOOT_ENCRYPTION && CRYPT_PW
	help
	  This option adds support to fall back from crypt-hashed
	  passwords to checking a SHA256 hashed password in case the
	  'bootstopusesha256' environment variable is set to 'true'.

config AUTOBOOT_DELAY_STR
	string "Delay autobooting via specific input key / string"
	depends on !AUTOBOOT_ENCRYPTION
	help
	  This option delays the automatic boot feature by issuing
	  a specific input key or string. If CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_DELAY_STR
	  or the environment variable "bootdelaykey" is specified
	  and this string is received from console input before
	  autoboot starts booting, U-Boot gives a command prompt. The
	  U-Boot prompt will time out if CONFIG_BOOT_RETRY_TIME is
	  used, otherwise it never times out.

config AUTOBOOT_STOP_STR
	string "Stop autobooting via specific input key / string"
	depends on !AUTOBOOT_ENCRYPTION
	help
	  This option enables stopping (aborting) of the automatic
	  boot feature only by issuing a specific input key or
	  string. If CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_STOP_STR or the environment
	  variable "bootstopkey" is specified and this string is
	  received from console input before autoboot starts booting,
	  U-Boot gives a command prompt. The U-Boot prompt never
	  times out, even if CONFIG_BOOT_RETRY_TIME is used.

config AUTOBOOT_KEYED_CTRLC
	bool "Enable Ctrl-C autoboot interruption"
	depends on !AUTOBOOT_ENCRYPTION
	help
	  This option allows for the boot sequence to be interrupted
	  by ctrl-c, in addition to the "bootdelaykey" and "bootstopkey".
	  Setting this variable	provides an escape sequence from the
	  limited "password" strings.

config AUTOBOOT_NEVER_TIMEOUT
	bool "Make the password entry never time-out"
	depends on AUTOBOOT_ENCRYPTION && CRYPT_PW
	help
	  This option removes the timeout from the password entry
	  when the user first presses the <Enter> key before entering
	  any other character.

config AUTOBOOT_STOP_STR_ENABLE
	bool "Enable fixed string to stop autobooting"
	depends on AUTOBOOT_ENCRYPTION
	help
	  This option enables the feature to add a fixed stop
	  string that is defined at compile time.
	  In every case it will be tried to load the stop
	  string from the environment.
	  In case this is enabled and there is no stop string
	  in the environment, this will be used as default value.

config AUTOBOOT_STOP_STR_CRYPT
	string "Stop autobooting via crypt-hashed password"
	depends on AUTOBOOT_STOP_STR_ENABLE && CRYPT_PW
	help
	  This option adds the feature to only stop the autobooting,
	  and therefore boot into the U-Boot prompt, when the input
	  string / password matches a values that is hashed via
	  one of the supported crypt-style password hashing options
	  and saved in the environment variable "bootstopkeycrypt".

config AUTOBOOT_STOP_STR_SHA256
	string "Stop autobooting via SHA256 hashed password"
	depends on AUTOBOOT_STOP_STR_ENABLE
	help
	  This option adds the feature to only stop the autobooting,
	  and therefore boot into the U-Boot prompt, when the input
	  string / password matches a values that is encrypted via
	  a SHA256 hash and saved in the environment variable
	  "bootstopkeysha256". If the value in that variable
	  includes a ":", the portion prior to the ":" will be treated
	  as a salt value.

config AUTOBOOT_MENUKEY
	int "ASCII value of boot key to show a menu"

	depends on AUTOBOOT_USE_MENUKEY
	help
	  If this key is pressed to stop autoboot, then the commands in the

	  For example, 33 means "!" in ASCII, so pressing ! at boot would take
	  this action.

	  If this option is enabled, user can not enter the U-Boot console from
	  bootmenu. It increases the system security.

config BOOT_RETRY
	bool "Boot retry feature"
	help
	  Allow for having the U-Boot command prompt time out and attempt
	  to boot again.  If the environment variable "bootretry" is found then
	  its value is used, otherwise the retry timeout is
	  CONFIG_BOOT_RETRY_TIME.  CONFIG_BOOT_RETRY_MIN is optional and
	  defaults to CONFIG_BOOT_RETRY_TIME. All times are in seconds.

config BOOT_RETRY_TIME
	int "Timeout in seconds before attempting to boot again"
	depends on BOOT_RETRY
