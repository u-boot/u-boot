config CMD_IOTRACE
	bool "iotrace - Support for tracing I/O activity"
	help
	  Provides an 'iotrace' command which supports recording I/O reads and
	  writes in a trace buffer in memory . It also maintains a checksum
	  of the trace records (even if space is exhausted) so that the
	  sequence of I/O accesses can be verified.

	  When debugging drivers it is useful to see what I/O accesses were
	  done and in what order.

	  Even if the individual accesses are of little interest it can be
	  useful to verify that the access pattern is consistent each time
	  an operation is performed. In this case a checksum can be used to
	  characterise the operation of a driver. The checksum can be compared
	  across different runs of the operation to verify that the driver is
	  working properly.

	  In particular, when performing major refactoring of the driver, where
	  the access pattern should not change, the checksum provides assurance
	  that the refactoring work has not broken the driver.

	  This works by sneaking into the io.h heder for an architecture and
	  redirecting I/O accesses through iotrace's tracing mechanism.

	  For now no commands are provided to examine the trace buffer. The
	  format is fairly simple, so 'md' is a reasonable substitute.

	  Note: The checksum feature is only useful for I/O regions where the
	  contents do not change outside of software control. Where this is not
	  suitable you can fall back to manually comparing the addresses. It
	  might be useful to enhance tracing to only checksum the accesses and
	  not the data read/written.

	help
	  This is used with the Freescale secure boot mechanism.

	  Freescale's SEC block has built-in Blob Protocol which provides
	  a method for protecting user-defined data across system power
	  cycles. SEC block protects data in a data structure called a Blob,
	  which provides both confidentiality and integrity protection.

	  Encapsulating data as a blob
	  Each time that the Blob Protocol is used to protect data, a
	  different randomly generated key is used to encrypt the data.
	  This random key is itself encrypted using a key which is derived
	  from SoC's non-volatile secret key and a 16 bit Key identifier.
	  The resulting encrypted key along with encrypted data is called a
	  blob. The non-volatile secure key is available for use only during
	  secure boot.

	  During decapsulation, the reverse process is performed to get back
	  the original data.

	  Sub-commands:
	    blob enc - encapsulating data as a cryptgraphic blob
	    blob dec - decapsulating cryptgraphic blob to get the data

	  Syntax:

	  blob enc src dst len km

	  Encapsulate and create blob of data $len bytes long
	  at address $src and store the result at address $dst.
	  $km is the 16 byte key modifier is also required for
	  generation/use as key for cryptographic operation. Key
	  modifier should be 16 byte long.

	  blob dec src dst len km
