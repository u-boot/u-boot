	  This provides a way to record console output (and provide console

	  Console output is recorded even when the console is silent.
	  To enable console recording, call console_record_reset_enable()

config SILENT_CONSOLE
	bool "Support a silent console"
	help
	  This option allows the console to be silenced, meaning that no
	  output will appear on the console devices. This is controlled by
	  setting the environment variable 'silent' to a non-empty value.
	  Note this also silences the console when booting Linux.

	  When the console is set up, the variable is checked, and the
	  GD_FLG_SILENT flag is set. Changing the environment variable later
	  will update the flag.

config SILENT_U_BOOT_ONLY
	bool "Only silence the U-Boot console"
	depends on SILENT_CONSOLE
	help
	  Normally when the U-Boot console is silenced, Linux's console is
	  also silenced (assuming the board boots into Linux). This option
	  allows the linux console to operate normally, even if U-Boot's
	  is silenced.

config SILENT_CONSOLE_UPDATE_ON_SET
	bool "Changes to the 'silent' environment variable update immediately"
	depends on SILENT_CONSOLE
	default y if SILENT_CONSOLE
	help
	  When the 'silent' environment variable is changed, update the
	  console silence flag immediately. This allows 'setenv' to be used
	  to silence or un-silence the console.

	  The effect is that any change to the variable will affect the
	  GD_FLG_SILENT flag.

config SILENT_CONSOLE_UPDATE_ON_RELOC
	bool "Allow flags to take effect on relocation"
	depends on SILENT_CONSOLE
	help
	  In some cases the environment is not available until relocation
	  (e.g. NAND). This option makes the value of the 'silent'
	  environment variable take effect at relocation.

config PRE_CONSOLE_BUFFER
	bool "Buffer characters before the console is available"
	help
	  Prior to the console being initialised (i.e. serial UART
	  initialised etc) all console output is silently discarded.
	  Defining CONFIG_PRE_CONSOLE_BUFFER will cause U-Boot to
	  buffer any console messages prior to the console being
	  initialised to a buffer. The buffer is a circular buffer, so
	  if it overflows, earlier output is discarded.

	  Note that this is not currently supported in SPL. It would be
	  useful to be able to share the pre-console buffer with SPL.

config PRE_CON_BUF_SZ
	int "Sets the size of the pre-console buffer"
	depends on PRE_CONSOLE_BUFFER
	default 4096
	help
	  The size of the pre-console buffer affects how much console output
	  can be held before it overflows and starts discarding earlier
	  output. Normally there is very little output at this early stage,
	  unless debugging is enabled, so allow enough for ~10 lines of
	  text.

	  This is a useful feature if you are using a video console and
	  want to see the full boot output on the console. Without this
	  option only the post-relocation output will be displayed.

config PRE_CON_BUF_ADDR
	hex "Address of the pre-console buffer"

	default 0x0f000000 if ROCKCHIP_RK3288
	default 0x0f200000 if ROCKCHIP_RK3399
	help
	  This sets the start address of the pre-console buffer. This must
	  be in available memory and is accessed before relocation and
	  possibly before DRAM is set up. Therefore choose an address
	  carefully.

	  We should consider removing this option and allocating the memory
	  in board_init_f_init_reserve() instead.

config CONSOLE_MUX
	bool "Enable console multiplexing"
	default y if DM_VIDEO || VIDEO || LCD
	help
	  This allows multiple devices to be used for each console 'file'.
	  For example, stdout can be set to go to serial and video.
	  Similarly, stdin can be set to come from serial and keyboard.
	  Input can be provided from either source. Console multiplexing
	  adds a small amount of size to U-Boot.  Changes to the environment
	  variables stdout, stdin and stderr will take effect immediately.

config SYS_CONSOLE_IS_IN_ENV
	bool "Select console devices from the environment"
	default y if CONSOLE_MUX
	help
	  This allows multiple input/output devices to be set at boot time.
	  For example, if stdout is set to "serial,video" then output will
	  be sent to both the serial and video devices on boot. The
	  environment variables can be updated after boot to change the
	  input/output devices.

config SYS_CONSOLE_OVERWRITE_ROUTINE
	bool "Allow board control over console overwriting"
	help
	  If this is enabled, and the board-specific function
	  overwrite_console() returns 1, the stdin, stderr and stdout are
	  switched to the serial port, else the settings in the environment
	  are used. If this is not enabled, the console will not be switched
	  to serial.

config SYS_CONSOLE_ENV_OVERWRITE
	bool "Update environment variables during console init"
	help
	  The console environment variables (stdout, stdin, stderr) can be
	  used to determine the correct console devices on start-up. This
	  option writes the console devices to these variables on console
	  start-up (after relocation). This causes the environment to be
	  updated to match the console devices actually chosen.

config SYS_CONSOLE_INFO_QUIET
	bool "Don't display the console devices on boot"
	help
	  Normally U-Boot displays the current settings for stdout, stdin
	  and stderr on boot when the post-relocation console is set up.
	  Enable this option to suppress this output. It can be obtained by
	  calling stdio_print_current_devices() from board code.

config SYS_STDIO_DEREGISTER
	bool "Allow deregistering stdio devices"
	default y if USB_KEYBOARD
	help
	  Generally there is no need to deregister stdio devices since they
	  are never deactivated. But if a stdio device is used which can be
	  removed (for example a USB keyboard) then this option can be
	  enabled to ensure this is handled correctly.

config SPL_SYS_STDIO_DEREGISTER
	bool "Allow deregistering stdio devices in SPL"
	help
	  Generally there is no need to deregister stdio devices since they
	  are never deactivated. But if a stdio device is used which can be
	  removed (for example a USB keyboard) then this option can be
	  enabled to ensure this is handled correctly. This is very rarely
	  needed in SPL.

config SYS_DEVICE_NULLDEV
	bool "Enable a null device for stdio"
	default y if SPLASH_SCREEN || SYS_STDIO_DEREGISTER
	help
	  Enable creation of a "nulldev" stdio device. This allows silent
