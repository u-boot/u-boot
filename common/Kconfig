	help
	  This option enables stopping (aborting) of the automatic
	  boot feature only by issuing a specific input key or
	  string. If not enabled, any input key will abort the
	  U-Boot automatic booting process and bring the device
	  to the U-Boot prompt for user input.

config AUTOBOOT_PROMPT

	depends on AUTOBOOT_KEYED
	default "Autoboot in %d seconds\\n"
	help
	  This string is displayed before the boot delay selected by
	  CONFIG_BOOTDELAY starts. If it is not defined	there is no
	  output indicating that autoboot is in progress.

	  Note that this define is used as the (only) argument to a
	  printf() call, so it may contain '%' format specifications,
	  provided that it also includes, sepearated by commas exactly
	  like in a printf statement, the required arguments. It is

	  This option delays the automatic boot feature by issuing
	  a specific input key or string. If CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_DELAY_STR
	  or the environment variable "bootdelaykey" is specified
	  and this string is received from console input before
	  autoboot starts booting, U-Boot gives a command prompt. The
	  U-Boot prompt will time out if CONFIG_BOOT_RETRY_TIME is
	  used, otherwise it never times out.

config AUTOBOOT_STOP_STR
	string "Stop autobooting via specific input key / string"
	depends on AUTOBOOT_KEYED && !AUTOBOOT_ENCRYPTION
	help
	  This option enables stopping (aborting) of the automatic

	  string. If CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_STOP_STR or the environment
	  variable "bootstopkey" is specified and this string is
	  received from console input before autoboot starts booting,
	  U-Boot gives a command prompt. The U-Boot prompt never

config AUTOBOOT_KEYED_CTRLC
	bool "Enable Ctrl-C autoboot interruption"

	default n
	help
	  This option allows for the boot sequence to be interrupted
	  by ctrl-c, in addition to the "bootdelaykey" and "bootstopkey".
	  Setting this variable	provides an escape sequence from the
	  limited "password" strings.

config AUTOBOOT_STOP_STR_SHA256
	string "Stop autobooting via SHA256 encrypted password"
	depends on AUTOBOOT_KEYED && AUTOBOOT_ENCRYPTION
	help
	  This option adds the feature to only stop the autobooting,
	  and therefore boot into the U-Boot prompt, when the input
	  string / password matches a values that is encypted via
	  a SHA256 hash and saved in the environment.

	  give the entry a name with bootstage_mark_name(). You can also
	  record elapsed time in a particular stage using bootstage_start()
	  before starting and bootstage_accum() when finished. Bootstage will
	  add up all the accumated time and report it.

	  Normally, IDs are defined in bootstage.h but a small number of
	  additional 'user' IDs can be used but passing BOOTSTAGE_ID_ALLOC
	  as the ID.
