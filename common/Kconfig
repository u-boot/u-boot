config BOOTSTAGE
	bool "Boot timing and reporting"
	help
	  Enable recording of boot time while booting. To use it, insert
	  calls to bootstage_mark() with a suitable BOOTSTAGE_ID from
	  bootstage.h. Only a single entry is recorded for each ID. You can
	  give the entry a name with bootstage_mark_name(). You can also
	  record elapsed time in a particular stage using bootstage_start()
	  before starting and bootstage_accum() when finished. Bootstage will
	  add up all the accumated time and report it.

	  Normally, IDs are defined in bootstage.h but a small number of
	  additional 'user' IDs can be used but passing BOOTSTAGE_ID_ALLOC
	  as the ID.

	  Calls to show_boot_progress() wil also result in log entries but
	  these will not have names.

config BOOTSTAGE_REPORT
	bool "Display a detailed boot timing report before booting the OS"
	depends on BOOTSTAGE
	help
	  Enable output of a boot time report just before the OS is booted.
	  This shows how long it took U-Boot to go through each stage of the
	  boot process. The report looks something like this:

		Timer summary in microseconds:
		       Mark    Elapsed  Stage
			  0          0  reset
		  3,575,678  3,575,678  board_init_f start

config BOOTSTAGE_USER_COUNT
	hex "Number of boot ID numbers available for user use"
	default 20
	help
	  This is the number of available user bootstage records.
	  Each time you call bootstage_mark(BOOTSTAGE_ID_ALLOC, ...)
	  a new ID will be allocated from this stash. If you exceed
	  the limit, recording will stop.

config CMD_BOOTSTAGE
	bool "Enable the 'bootstage' command"
	depends on BOOTSTAGE
	help
	  Add a 'bootstage' command which supports printing a report
	  and un/stashing of bootstage data.

config BOOTSTAGE_FDT
	bool "Store boot timing information in the OS device tree"
	depends on BOOTSTAGE
	help
	  Stash the bootstage information in the FDT. A root 'bootstage'
	  node is created with each bootstage id as a child. Each child
	  has a 'name' property and either 'mark' containing the
	  mark time in microsecond, or 'accum' containing the
	  accumulated time for that bootstage id in microseconds.
	  For example:

		bootstage {
			154 {
				name = "board_init_f";
				mark = <3575678>;
			};
			170 {
				name = "lcd";
				accum = <33482>;
			};
		};

	  Code in the Linux kernel can find this in /proc/devicetree.

config BOOTSTAGE_STASH
	bool "Stash the boot timing information in memory before booting OS"
	depends on BOOTSTAGE
	help
	  Some OSes do not support device tree. Bootstage can instead write
	  the boot timing information in a binary format at a given address.
	  This happens through a call to bootstage_stash(), typically in
	  the CPU's cleanup_before_linux() function. You can use the
	  'bootstage stash' and 'bootstage unstash' commands to do this on
	  the command line.

config BOOTSTAGE_STASH_ADDR
	hex "Address to stash boot timing information"
	default 0
	help
	  Provide an address which will not be overwritten by the OS when it
	  starts, so that it can read this information when ready.

config BOOTSTAGE_STASH_SIZE
	hex "Size of boot timing stash region"
	default 4096
	help
	  This should be large enough to hold the bootstage stash. A value of
	  4096 (4KiB) is normally plenty.
