config BOOTSTAGE
	bool "Boot timing and reporting"
	help
	  Enable recording of boot time while booting. To use it, insert
	  calls to bootstage_mark() with a suitable BOOTSTAGE_ID from
	  bootstage.h. Only a single entry is recorded for each ID. You can
	  give the entry a name with bootstage_mark_name(). You can also
	  record elapsed time in a particular stage using bootstage_start()
	  before starting and bootstage_accum() when finished. Bootstage will
	  add up all the accumulated time and report it.

	  Normally, IDs are defined in bootstage.h but a small number of
	  additional 'user' IDs can be used by passing BOOTSTAGE_ID_ALLOC
	  as the ID.

	  Calls to show_boot_progress() will also result in log entries but
	  these will not have names.

config SPL_BOOTSTAGE
	bool "Boot timing and reported in SPL"
	depends on BOOTSTAGE
	help
	  Enable recording of boot time in SPL. To make this visible to U-Boot
	  proper, enable BOOTSTAGE_STASH as well. This will stash the timing
	  information when SPL finishes and load it when U-Boot proper starts
	  up.

config BOOTSTAGE_REPORT
	bool "Display a detailed boot timing report before booting the OS"
	depends on BOOTSTAGE
	help
	  Enable output of a boot time report just before the OS is booted.
	  This shows how long it took U-Boot to go through each stage of the
	  boot process. The report looks something like this:

		Timer summary in microseconds:
		       Mark    Elapsed  Stage
			  0          0  reset
		  3,575,678  3,575,678  board_init_f start

config BOOTSTAGE_FDT
	bool "Store boot timing information in the OS device tree"
	depends on BOOTSTAGE
	help
	  Stash the bootstage information in the FDT. A root 'bootstage'
	  node is created with each bootstage id as a child. Each child
	  has a 'name' property and either 'mark' containing the
	  mark time in microseconds, or 'accum' containing the
	  accumulated time for that bootstage id in microseconds.
	  For example:

		bootstage {
			154 {
				name = "board_init_f";
				mark = <3575678>;
			};
			170 {
				name = "lcd";
				accum = <33482>;
			};
		};

	  Code in the Linux kernel can find this in /proc/devicetree.

config BOOTSTAGE_STASH
	bool "Stash the boot timing information in memory before booting OS"
	depends on BOOTSTAGE
	help
	  Some OSes do not support device tree. Bootstage can instead write
	  the boot timing information in a binary format at a given address.
	  This happens through a call to bootstage_stash(), typically in
	  the CPU's cleanup_before_linux() function. You can use the
	  'bootstage stash' and 'bootstage unstash' commands to do this on
	  the command line.

config BOOTSTAGE_STASH_ADDR
	hex "Address to stash boot timing information"
	default 0
	help
	  Provide an address which will not be overwritten by the OS when it
	  starts, so that it can read this information when ready.

config BOOTSTAGE_STASH_SIZE

	default 0x1000
	help
	  This should be large enough to hold the bootstage stash. A value of
	  4096 (4KiB) is normally plenty.

config ENV_IS_IN_DATAFLASH
	bool "Environment in dataflash"
	depends on !CHAIN_OF_TRUST
	help
	  Define this if you have a DataFlash memory device which you
	  want to use for the environment.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET:
	  - CONFIG_ENV_ADDR:
	  - CONFIG_ENV_SIZE:

	  These three #defines specify the offset and size of the
	  environment area within the total memory of your DataFlash placed
	  at the specified address.

config ENV_IS_IN_EEPROM
	bool "Environment in EEPROM"
	depends on !CHAIN_OF_TRUST
	help
	  Use this if you have an EEPROM or similar serial access
	  device and a driver for it.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET:
	  - CONFIG_ENV_SIZE:

	  These two #defines specify the offset and size of the
	  environment area within the total memory of your EEPROM.

	  - CONFIG_SYS_I2C_EEPROM_ADDR:
	  If defined, specified the chip address of the EEPROM device.
	  The default address is zero.

	  - CONFIG_SYS_I2C_EEPROM_BUS:
	  If defined, specified the i2c bus of the EEPROM device.

	  - CONFIG_SYS_EEPROM_PAGE_WRITE_BITS:
	  If defined, the number of bits used to address bytes in a
	  single page in the EEPROM device.  A 64 byte page, for example
	  would require six bits.

	  - CONFIG_SYS_EEPROM_PAGE_WRITE_DELAY_MS:
	  If defined, the number of milliseconds to delay between
	  page writes.	The default is zero milliseconds.

	  - CONFIG_SYS_I2C_EEPROM_ADDR_LEN:
	  The length in bytes of the EEPROM memory array address.  Note
	  that this is NOT the chip address length!

	  - CONFIG_SYS_I2C_EEPROM_ADDR_OVERFLOW:
	  EEPROM chips that implement "address overflow" are ones
	  like Catalyst 24WC04/08/16 which has 9/10/11 bits of
	  address and the extra bits end up in the "chip address" bit
	  slots. This makes a 24WC08 (1Kbyte) chip look like four 256
	  byte chips.

	  Note that we consider the length of the address field to
	  still be one byte because the extra address bits are hidden
	  in the chip address.

	  - CONFIG_SYS_EEPROM_SIZE:
	  The size in bytes of the EEPROM device.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_EEPROM_IS_ON_I2C
	  define this, if you have I2C and SPI activated, and your
	  EEPROM, which holds the environment, is on the I2C bus.

	  - CONFIG_I2C_ENV_EEPROM_BUS
	  if you have an Environment on an EEPROM reached over
	  I2C muxes, you can define here, how to reach this
	  EEPROM. For example:

	  #define CONFIG_I2C_ENV_EEPROM_BUS	  1

	  EEPROM which holds the environment, is reached over
	  a pca9547 i2c mux with address 0x70, channel 3.

config ENV_IS_IN_FLASH
	bool "Environment in flash memory"
	depends on !CHAIN_OF_TRUST
	help
	  Define this if you have a flash device which you want to use for the
	  environment.

	  a) The environment occupies one whole flash sector, which is
	   "embedded" in the text segment with the U-Boot code. This
	   happens usually with "bottom boot sector" or "top boot
	   sector" type flash chips, which have several smaller
	   sectors at the start or the end. For instance, such a
	   layout can have sector sizes of 8, 2x4, 16, Nx32 kB. In
	   such a case you would place the environment in one of the
	   4 kB sectors - with U-Boot code before and after it. With
	   "top boot sector" type flash chips, you would put the
	   environment in one of the last sectors, leaving a gap
	   between U-Boot and the environment.

	  CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET:

	   Offset of environment data (variable area) to the
	   beginning of flash memory; for instance, with bottom boot
	   type flash chips the second sector can be used: the offset
	   for this sector is given here.

	   CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET is used relative to CONFIG_SYS_FLASH_BASE.

	  CONFIG_ENV_ADDR:

	   This is just another way to specify the start address of
	   the flash sector containing the environment (instead of
	   CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET).

	  CONFIG_ENV_SECT_SIZE:

	   Size of the sector containing the environment.


	  b) Sometimes flash chips have few, equal sized, BIG sectors.
	   In such a case you don't want to spend a whole sector for
	   the environment.

	  CONFIG_ENV_SIZE:

	   If you use this in combination with CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_FLASH
	   and CONFIG_ENV_SECT_SIZE, you can specify to use only a part
	   of this flash sector for the environment. This saves
	   memory for the RAM copy of the environment.

	   It may also save flash memory if you decide to use this
	   when your environment is "embedded" within U-Boot code,
	   since then the remainder of the flash sector could be used
	   for U-Boot code. It should be pointed out that this is
	   STRONGLY DISCOURAGED from a robustness point of view:
	   updating the environment in flash makes it always
	   necessary to erase the WHOLE sector. If something goes
	   wrong before the contents has been restored from a copy in
	   RAM, your target system will be dead.

	  CONFIG_ENV_ADDR_REDUND
	  CONFIG_ENV_SIZE_REDUND

	   These settings describe a second storage area used to hold
	   a redundant copy of the environment data, so that there is
	   a valid backup copy in case there is a power failure during
	   a "saveenv" operation.

	  BE CAREFUL! Any changes to the flash layout, and some changes to the
	  source code will make it necessary to adapt <board>/u-boot.lds*
	  accordingly!

config ENV_IS_IN_MMC
	bool "Environment in an MMC device"
	depends on !CHAIN_OF_TRUST
	default y if ARCH_SUNXI
	help
	  Define this if you have an MMC device which you want to use for the
	  environment.

	  CONFIG_SYS_MMC_ENV_DEV:

	  Specifies which MMC device the environment is stored in.

	  CONFIG_SYS_MMC_ENV_PART (optional):

	  Specifies which MMC partition the environment is stored in. If not
	  set, defaults to partition 0, the user area. Common values might be
	  1 (first MMC boot partition), 2 (second MMC boot partition).

	  CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET:
	  CONFIG_ENV_SIZE:

	  These two #defines specify the offset and size of the environment
	  area within the specified MMC device.

	  If offset is positive (the usual case), it is treated as relative to
	  the start of the MMC partition. If offset is negative, it is treated
	  as relative to the end of the MMC partition. This can be useful if
	  your board may be fitted with different MMC devices, which have
	  different sizes for the MMC partitions, and you always want the
	  environment placed at the very end of the partition, to leave the
	  maximum possible space before it, to store other data.

	  These two values are in units of bytes, but must be aligned to an
	  MMC sector boundary.

	  CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND (optional):

	  Specifies a second storage area, of CONFIG_ENV_SIZE size, used to
	  hold a redundant copy of the environment data. This provides a
	  valid backup copy in case the other copy is corrupted, e.g. due
	  to a power failure during a "saveenv" operation.

	  This value may also be positive or negative; this is handled in the
	  same way as CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET.

	  This value is also in units of bytes, but must also be aligned to
	  an MMC sector boundary.

	  CONFIG_ENV_SIZE_REDUND (optional):

	  This value need not be set, even when CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND is
	  set. If this value is set, it must be set to the same value as
	  CONFIG_ENV_SIZE.

config ENV_IS_IN_NAND
	bool "Environment in a NAND device"
	depends on !CHAIN_OF_TRUST
	help
	  Define this if you have a NAND device which you want to use for the
	  environment.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET:
	  - CONFIG_ENV_SIZE:

	  These two #defines specify the offset and size of the environment
	  area within the first NAND device.  CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET must be
	  aligned to an erase block boundary.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND (optional):

	  This setting describes a second storage area of CONFIG_ENV_SIZE
	  size used to hold a redundant copy of the environment data, so
	  that there is a valid backup copy in case there is a power failure
	  during a "saveenv" operation.	 CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND must be
	  aligned to an erase block boundary.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_RANGE (optional):

	  Specifies the length of the region in which the environment
	  can be written.  This should be a multiple of the NAND device's
	  block size.  Specifying a range with more erase blocks than
	  are needed to hold CONFIG_ENV_SIZE allows bad blocks within
	  the range to be avoided.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_OOB (optional):

	  Enables support for dynamically retrieving the offset of the
	  environment from block zero's out-of-band data.  The
	  "nand env.oob" command can be used to record this offset.
	  Currently, CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND is not supported when
	  using CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_OOB.

config ENV_IS_IN_NVRAM
	bool "Environment in a non-volatile RAM"
	depends on !CHAIN_OF_TRUST
	help
	  Define this if you have some non-volatile memory device
	  (NVRAM, battery buffered SRAM) which you want to use for the
	  environment.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_ADDR:
	  - CONFIG_ENV_SIZE:

	  These two #defines are used to determine the memory area you
	  want to use for environment. It is assumed that this memory
	  can just be read and written to, without any special
	  provision.

config ENV_IS_IN_SPI_FLASH
	bool "Environment is in SPI flash"
	depends on !CHAIN_OF_TRUST
	help
	  Define this if you have a SPI Flash memory device which you
	  want to use for the environment.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET:
	  - CONFIG_ENV_SIZE:

	  These two #defines specify the offset and size of the
	  environment area within the SPI Flash. CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET must be
	  aligned to an erase sector boundary.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_SECT_SIZE:

	  Define the SPI flash's sector size.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND (optional):

	  This setting describes a second storage area of CONFIG_ENV_SIZE
	  size used to hold a redundant copy of the environment data, so
	  that there is a valid backup copy in case there is a power failure
	  during a "saveenv" operation. CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND must be
	  aligned to an erase sector boundary.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_SPI_BUS (optional):
	  - CONFIG_ENV_SPI_CS (optional):

	  Define the SPI bus and chip select. If not defined they will be 0.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_SPI_MAX_HZ (optional):

	  Define the SPI max work clock. If not defined then use 1MHz.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_SPI_MODE (optional):

	  Define the SPI work mode. If not defined then use SPI_MODE_3.

config ENV_IS_IN_UBI
	bool "Environment in a UBI volume"
	depends on !CHAIN_OF_TRUST
	help
	  Define this if you have an UBI volume that you want to use for the

	  accesses, which is important on NAND.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_UBI_PART:

	  Define this to a string that is the mtd partition containing the UBI.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_UBI_VOLUME:

	  Define this to the name of the volume that you want to store the
	  environment in.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_UBI_VOLUME_REDUND:

	  Define this to the name of another volume to store a second copy of

	  It is assumed that both volumes are in the same MTD partition.

	  - CONFIG_UBI_SILENCE_MSG

	  This option allows the console to be silenced, meaning that no

	  setting the environment vaariable 'silent' to a non-empty value.
	  Note this also silences the console when booting Linux.

	  When the console is set up, the variable is checked, and the
	  GD_FLG_SILENT flag is set. Changing the environment variable later
	  will update the flag.

config SILENT_U_BOOT_ONLY

	depends on SILENT_CONSOLE
	help
	  Normally when the U-Boot console is silenced, Linux's console is

	help
	  Prior to the console being initialised (i.e. serial UART
	  initialised etc) all console output is silently discarded.
	  Defining CONFIG_PRE_CONSOLE_BUFFER will cause U-Boot to
	  buffer any console messages prior to the console being
	  initialised to a buffer. The buffer is a circular buffer, so
	  if it overflows, earlier output is discarded.

	  Note that this is not currently supported in SPL. It would be

	  The size of the pre-console buffer affects how much console output
	  can be held before it overflows and starts discarding earlier
	  output. Normally there is very little output at this early stage,
	  unless debugging is enabled, so allow enough for ~10 lines of
	  text.

	  This is a useful feature if you are using a video console and

	  Enable this option to supress this output. It can be obtained by
	  calling stdio_print_current_devices() from board code.

config SYS_STDIO_DEREGISTER
	bool "Allow deregistering stdio devices"
	default y if USB_KEYBOARD
	help
	  Generally there is no need to deregister stdio devices since they
	  are never deactivated. But if a stdio device is used which can be
	  removed (for example a USB keyboard) then this option can be
	  enabled to ensure this is handled correctly.

config DTB_RESELECT
	bool "Support swapping dtbs at a later point in boot"
	depends on FIT_EMBED
	help
	  It is possible during initial boot you may need to use a generic
	  dtb until you can fully determine the board your running on. This
	  config allows boards to implement a function at a later point
	  during boot to switch to the "correct" dtb.

config FIT_EMBED
	bool "Support a FIT image embedded in the U-boot image"
	help
	  This option provides hooks to allow U-boot to parse an
	  appended FIT image and enable board specific code to then select
	  the correct DTB to be used.

config DEFAULT_FDT_FILE
	string "Default fdt file"
	help
	  This option is used to set the default fdt file to boot OS.

config VERSION_VARIABLE
	bool "add U-Boot environment variable vers"
	default n
	help
	  If this variable is defined, an environment variable
	  named "ver" is created by U-Boot showing the U-Boot
	  version as printed by the "version" command.
	  Any change to this variable will be reverted at the
	  next reset.

config BOARD_LATE_INIT
	bool
	help
	  Sometimes board require some initialization code that might
	  require once the actual init done, example saving board specific env,
	  boot-modes etc. which eventually done at late.

	  So this config enable the late init code with the help of board_late_init
	  function which should defined on respective boards.

config DISPLAY_CPUINFO
	bool "Display information about the CPU during start up"
	default y if ARM || NIOS2 || X86 || XTENSA
	help
	  Display information about the CPU that U-Boot is running on
	  when U-Boot starts up. The function print_cpuinfo() is called
	  to do this.

config DISPLAY_BOARDINFO
	bool "Display information about the board during start up"
	default y if ARM || M68K || MIPS || PPC || SANDBOX || XTENSA
	help
	  Display information about the board that U-Boot is running on
	  when U-Boot starts up. The board function checkboard() is called
	  to do this.

config ARCH_EARLY_INIT_R
	bool "Call arch-specific init soon after relocation"
	default y if X86
	help
	  With this option U-Boot will call arch_early_init_r() soon after
	  relocation. Driver model is running by this point, and the cache
	  is on. Note that board_early_init_r() is called first, if
	  enabled. This can be used to set up architecture-specific devices.

config ARCH_MISC_INIT
	bool "Call arch-specific init after relocation, when console is ready"
	help
	  With this option U-Boot will call arch_misc_init() after
	  relocation to allow miscellaneous arch-dependent initialisation
	  to be performed. This function should be defined by the board
	  and will be called after the console is set up, after relocaiton.

config BOARD_EARLY_INIT_F
	bool "Call board-specific init before relocation"
	default y if X86
	help
	  Some boards need to perform initialisation as soon as possible
	  after boot. With this option, U-Boot calls board_early_init_f()
	  after driver model is ready in the pre-relocation init sequence.
	  Note that the normal serial console is not yet set up, but the
	  debug UART will be available if enabled.

config HASH
	bool # "Support hashing API (SHA1, SHA256, etc.)"
	help
	  This provides a way to hash data in memory using various supported
	  algorithms (such as SHA1, MD5, CRC32). The API is defined in hash.h
	  and the algorithms it supports are defined in common/hash.c. See
	  also CMD_HASH for command-line access.
