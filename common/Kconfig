config HUSH_PARSER
	bool "Use hush shell"
	select SYS_HUSH_PARSER
	help
	  This option enables the "hush" shell (from Busybox) as command line
	  interpreter, thus enabling powerful command line syntax like
	  if...then...else...fi conditionals or `&&' and '||'
	  constructs ("shell scripts").

	  If disabled, you get the old, much simpler behaviour with a somewhat
	  smaller memory footprint.

config SYS_HUSH_PARSER
