config BOOTSTAGE
	bool "Boot timing and reporting"
	help
	  Enable recording of boot time while booting. To use it, insert
	  calls to bootstage_mark() with a suitable BOOTSTAGE_ID from
	  bootstage.h. Only a single entry is recorded for each ID. You can
	  give the entry a name with bootstage_mark_name(). You can also
	  record elapsed time in a particular stage using bootstage_start()
	  before starting and bootstage_accum() when finished. Bootstage will
	  add up all the accumated time and report it.

	  Normally, IDs are defined in bootstage.h but a small number of
	  additional 'user' IDs can be used but passing BOOTSTAGE_ID_ALLOC
	  as the ID.

	  Calls to show_boot_progress() wil also result in log entries but
	  these will not have names.

config BOOTSTAGE_REPORT
	bool "Display a detailed boot timing report before booting the OS"
	depends on BOOTSTAGE
	help
	  Enable output of a boot time report just before the OS is booted.
	  This shows how long it took U-Boot to go through each stage of the
	  boot process. The report looks something like this:

		Timer summary in microseconds:
		       Mark    Elapsed  Stage
			  0          0  reset
		  3,575,678  3,575,678  board_init_f start
		  3,575,695         17  arch_cpu_init A9
		  3,575,777         82  arch_cpu_init done
		  3,659,598     83,821  board_init_r start
		  3,910,375    250,777  main_loop
		 29,916,167 26,005,792  bootm_start
		 30,361,327    445,160  start_kernel

config BOOTSTAGE_USER_COUNT
	hex "Number of boot ID numbers available for user use"
	default 20
	help
	  This is the number of available user bootstage records.
	  Each time you call bootstage_mark(BOOTSTAGE_ID_ALLOC, ...)
	  a new ID will be allocated from this stash. If you exceed
	  the limit, recording will stop.

config BOOTSTAGE_FDT
	bool "Store boot timing information in the OS device tree"
	depends on BOOTSTAGE
	help
	  Stash the bootstage information in the FDT. A root 'bootstage'
	  node is created with each bootstage id as a child. Each child
	  has a 'name' property and either 'mark' containing the
	  mark time in microsecond, or 'accum' containing the
	  accumulated time for that bootstage id in microseconds.
	  For example:

		bootstage {
			154 {
				name = "board_init_f";
				mark = <3575678>;
			};
			170 {
				name = "lcd";
				accum = <33482>;
			};
		};

	  Code in the Linux kernel can find this in /proc/devicetree.

config BOOTSTAGE_STASH
	bool "Stash the boot timing information in memory before booting OS"
	depends on BOOTSTAGE
	help
	  Some OSes do not support device tree. Bootstage can instead write
	  the boot timing information in a binary format at a given address.
	  This happens through a call to bootstage_stash(), typically in
	  the CPU's cleanup_before_linux() function. You can use the
	  'bootstage stash' and 'bootstage unstash' commands to do this on
	  the command line.

config BOOTSTAGE_STASH_ADDR
	hex "Address to stash boot timing information"
	default 0
	help
	  Provide an address which will not be overwritten by the OS when it
	  starts, so that it can read this information when ready.

config BOOTSTAGE_STASH_SIZE
	hex "Size of boot timing stash region"
	default 4096
	help
	  This should be large enough to hold the bootstage stash. A value of
	  4096 (4KiB) is normally plenty.

config NOR_BOOT
	bool "Support for booting from NOR flash"
	depends on NOR
	help
	  Enabling this will make a U-Boot binary that is capable of being
	  booted via NOR.  In this case we will enable certain pinmux early
	  as the ROM only partially sets up pinmux.  We also default to using
	  NOR for environment.

config NAND_BOOT
	bool "Support for booting from NAND flash"
	default n
	help
	  Enabling this will make a U-Boot binary that is capable of being
	  booted via NAND flash. This is not a must, some SoCs need this,
	  somes not.

config ONENAND_BOOT
	bool "Support for booting from ONENAND"
	default n
	help
	  Enabling this will make a U-Boot binary that is capable of being
	  booted via ONENAND. This is not a must, some SoCs need this,
	  somes not.

config QSPI_BOOT
	bool "Support for booting from QSPI flash"
	default n
	help
	  Enabling this will make a U-Boot binary that is capable of being
	  booted via QSPI flash. This is not a must, some SoCs need this,
	  somes not.

config SATA_BOOT
	bool "Support for booting from SATA"
	default n
	help
	  Enabling this will make a U-Boot binary that is capable of being
	  booted via SATA. This is not a must, some SoCs need this,
	  somes not.

config SD_BOOT
	bool "Support for booting from SD/EMMC"
	default n
	help
	  Enabling this will make a U-Boot binary that is capable of being
	  booted via SD/EMMC. This is not a must, some SoCs need this,
	  somes not.

config SPI_BOOT
	bool "Support for booting from SPI flash"
	default n
	help
	  Enabling this will make a U-Boot binary that is capable of being
	  booted via SPI flash. This is not a must, some SoCs need this,
	  somes not.

config BOOTDELAY
	int "delay in seconds before automatically booting"
	default 2
	depends on AUTOBOOT
	help
	  Delay before automatically running bootcmd;
	  set to 0 to autoboot with no delay, but you can stop it by key input.
	  set to -1 to disable autoboot.
	  set to -2 to autoboot with no delay and not check for abort

	  See doc/README.autoboot for details.

config CONSOLE_RECORD
	bool "Console recording"
	help
	  This provides a way to record console output (and provide console
	  input) through cirular buffers. This is mostly useful for testing.
	  Console output is recorded even when the console is silent.
	  To enable console recording, call console_record_reset_enable()
	  from your code.

config CONSOLE_RECORD_OUT_SIZE
	hex "Output buffer size"
	depends on CONSOLE_RECORD
	default 0x400 if CONSOLE_RECORD
	help
	  Set the size of the console output buffer. When this fills up, no
	  more data will be recorded until some is removed. The buffer is
	  allocated immediately after the malloc() region is ready.

config CONSOLE_RECORD_IN_SIZE
	hex "Input buffer size"
	depends on CONSOLE_RECORD
	default 0x100 if CONSOLE_RECORD
	help
	  Set the size of the console input buffer. When this contains data,
	  tstc() and getc() will use this in preference to real device input.
	  The buffer is allocated immediately after the malloc() region is
	  ready.
