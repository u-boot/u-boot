config SPL_SYS_MALLOC_SIMPLE
	bool
	depends on SPL
	prompt "Only use malloc_simple functions in the SPL"
	help
	  Say Y here to only use the *_simple malloc functions from
	  malloc_simple.c, rather then using the versions from dlmalloc.c;
	  this will make the SPL binary smaller at the cost of more heap
	  usage as the *_simple malloc functions do not re-use free-ed mem.

config SPL_STACK_R
	depends on SPL
	bool "Enable SDRAM location for SPL stack"
	help
	  SPL starts off execution in SRAM and thus typically has only a small
	  stack available. Since SPL sets up DRAM while in its board_init_f()
	  function, it is possible for the stack to move there before
	  board_init_r() is reached. This option enables a special SDRAM
	  location for the SPL stack. U-Boot SPL switches to this after
	  board_init_f() completes, and before board_init_r() starts.

config SPL_STACK_R_ADDR
	depends on SPL_STACK_R
	hex "SDRAM location for SPL stack"
	help
	  Specify the address in SDRAM for the SPL stack. This will be set up

	help
	  Specify the amount of the stack to use as memory pool for
	  malloc_simple after switching the stack to DRAM. This may be set
	  to give board_init_r() a larger heap then the initial heap in
	  SRAM which is limited to SYS_MALLOC_F_LEN bytes.

config SPL_SEPARATE_BSS
	depends on SPL
	bool "BSS section is in a different memory region from text"
	help
	  Some platforms need a large BSS region in SPL and can provide this
	  because RAM is already set up. In this case BSS can be moved to RAM.
	  This option should then be enabled so that the correct device tree
	  location is used. Normally we put the device tree at the end of BSS
	  but with this option enabled, it goes at _image_binary_end.

config SPL_DISPLAY_PRINT
	depends on SPL
	bool "Display a board-specific message in SPL"

	  If you want to build TPL as well as the normal image and SPL, say Y.

config SPL_CRC32_SUPPORT
	bool "Support CRC32"
	depends on SPL_FIT
	help
	  Enable this to support CRC32 in FIT images within SPL. This is a
	  32-bit checksum value that can be used to verify images. This is
	  the least secure type of checksum, suitable for detected
	  accidental image corruption. For secure applications you should
	  consider SHA1 or SHA256.

config SPL_MD5_SUPPORT
	bool "Support MD5"
	depends on SPL_FIT
	help
	  Enable this to support MD5 in FIT images within SPL. An MD5
	  checksum is a 128-bit hash value used to check that the image
	  contents have not been corrupted. Note that MD5 is not considered
	  secure as it is possible (with a brute-force attack) to adjust the
	  image while still retaining the same MD5 hash value. For secure
	  applications where images may be changed maliciously, you should
	  consider SHA1 or SHA256.

config SPL_SHA1_SUPPORT
	bool "Support SHA1"
	depends on SPL_FIT
	help
	  Enable this to support SHA1 in FIT images within SPL. A SHA1
	  checksum is a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value used to check that the
	  image contents have not been corrupted or maliciously altered.
	  While SHA1 is fairly secure it is coming to the end of its life
	  due to the expanding computing power avaiable to brute-force
	  attacks. For more security, consider SHA256.

config SPL_SHA256_SUPPORT
	bool "Support SHA256"
	depends on SPL_FIT
	help
	  Enable this to support SHA256 in FIT images within SPL. A SHA256
	  checksum is a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value used to check that the
	  image contents have not been corrupted. SHA256 is recommended for
	  use in secure applications since (as at 2016) there is no known
	  feasible attack that could produce a 'collision' with differing
	  input data. Use this for the highest security. Note that only the
	  SHA256 variant is supported: SHA512 and others are not currently
	  supported in U-Boot.

config SPL_CPU_SUPPORT
	bool "Support CPU drivers"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable this to support CPU drivers in SPL. These drivers can set
	  up CPUs and provide information about them such as the model and
	  name. This can be useful in SPL since setting up the CPUs earlier
	  may improve boot performance. Enable this option to build the
	  drivers in drivers/cpu as part of an SPL build.

config SPL_CRYPTO_SUPPORT
	bool "Support crypto drivers"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable crypto drivers in SPL. These drivers can be used to
	  accelerate secure boot processing in secure applications. Enable
	  this option to build the drivers in drivers/crypto as part of an
	  SPL build.

config SPL_HASH_SUPPORT
	bool "Support hashing drivers"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable hashing drivers in SPL. These drivers can be used to
	  accelerate secure boot processing in secure applications. Enable
	  this option to build system-specific drivers for hash acceleration
	  as part of an SPL build.

config SPL_DMA_SUPPORT
	bool "Support DMA drivers"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable DMA (direct-memory-access) drivers in SPL. These drivers
	  can be used to handle memory-to-peripheral data transfer without
	  the CPU moving the data. Enable this option to build the drivers
	  in drivers/dma as part of an SPL build.

config SPL_DRIVERS_MISC_SUPPORT
	bool "Support misc drivers"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable miscellaneous drivers in SPL. These drivers perform various
	  tasks that don't fall nicely into other categories, Enable this
	  option to build the drivers in drivers/misc as part of an SPL
	  build, for those that support building in SPL (not all drivers do).

config SPL_ENV_SUPPORT
	bool "Support an environment"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable environment support in SPL. The U-Boot environment provides
	  a number of settings (essentially name/value pairs) which can
	  control many aspects of U-Boot's operation. Normally this is not
	  needed in SPL as it has a much simpler task with less
	  configuration. But some boards use this to support 'Falcon' boot
	  on EXT2 and FAT, where SPL boots directly into Linux without
	  starting U-Boot first. Enabling this option will make getenv()
	  and setenv() available in SPL.

config SPL_SAVEENV
	bool "Support save environment"
	depends on SPL && SPL_ENV_SUPPORT
	help
	  Enable save environment support in SPL after setenv. By default
	  the saveenv option is not provided in SPL, but some boards need
	  this support in 'Falcon' boot, where SPL need to boot from
	  different images based on environment variable set by OS. For
	  example OS may set "reboot_image" environment variable to
	  "recovery" inorder to boot recovery image by SPL. The SPL read
	  "reboot_image" and act accordingly and change the reboot_image
	  to default mode using setenv and save the environemnt.

config SPL_ETH_SUPPORT
	bool "Support Ethernet"
	depends on SPL_ENV_SUPPORT
	help
	  Enable access to the network subsystem and associated Ethernet
	  drivers in SPL. This permits SPL to load U-Boot over an Ethernet
	  link rather than from an on-board peripheral. Environment support
	  is required since the network stack uses a number of environment
	  variables. See also SPL_NET_SUPPORT.

config SPL_EXT_SUPPORT
	bool "Support EXT filesystems"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for EXT2/3/4 filesystems with SPL. This permits
	  U-Boot (or Linux in Falcon mode) to be loaded from an EXT
	  filesystem from within SPL. Support for the underlying block
	  device (e.g. MMC or USB) must be enabled separately.

config SPL_FAT_SUPPORT
	bool "Support FAT filesystems"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for FAT and VFAT filesystems with SPL. This
	  permits U-Boot (or Linux in Falcon mode) to be loaded from a FAT
	  filesystem from within SPL. Support for the underlying block
	  device (e.g. MMC or USB) must be enabled separately.

config SPL_FPGA_SUPPORT
	bool "Support FPGAs"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for FPGAs in SPL. Field-programmable Gate Arrays
	  provide software-configurable hardware which is typically used to
	  implement peripherals (such as UARTs, LCD displays, MMC) or
	  accelerate custom processing functions, such as image processing
	  or machine learning. Sometimes it is useful to program the FPGA
	  as early as possible during boot, and this option can enable that
	  within SPL.

config SPL_GPIO_SUPPORT
	bool "Support GPIO"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for GPIOs (General-purpose Input/Output) in SPL.
	  GPIOs allow U-Boot to read the state of an input line (high or
	  low) and set the state of an output line. This can be used to
	  drive LEDs, control power to various system parts and read user
	  input. GPIOs can be useful in SPL to enable a 'sign-of-life' LED,
	  for example. Enable this option to build the drivers in
	  drivers/gpio as part of an SPL build.

config SPL_I2C_SUPPORT
	bool "Support I2C"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for the I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) bus in SPL.
	  I2C works with a clock and data line which can be driven by a
	  one or more masters or slaves. It is a fairly complex bus but is
	  widely used as it only needs two lines for communication. Speeds of
	  400kbps are typical but up to 3.4Mbps is supported by some
	  hardware. I2C can be useful in SPL to configure power management
	  ICs (PMICs) before raising the CPU clock speed, for example.
	  Enable this option to build the drivers in drivers/i2c as part of
	  an SPL build.

config SPL_LIBCOMMON_SUPPORT
	bool "Support common libraries"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for common U-Boot libraries within SPL. These
	  libraries include common code to deal with U-Boot images,
	  environment and USB, for example. This option is enabled on many
	  boards. Enable this option to build the code in common/ as part of
	  an SPL build.

config SPL_LIBDISK_SUPPORT
	bool "Support disk paritions"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for disk partitions within SPL. 'Disk' is something
	  of a misnomer as it includes non-spinning media such as flash (as
	  used in MMC and USB sticks). Partitions provide a way for a disk
	  to be split up into separate regions, with a partition table placed
	  at the start or end which describes the location and size of each
	  'partition'. These partitions are typically uses as individual block
	  devices, typically with an EXT2 or FAT filesystem in each. This
	  option enables whatever partition support has been enabled in
	  U-Boot to also be used in SPL. It brings in the code in disk/.

config SPL_LIBGENERIC_SUPPORT
	bool "Support generic libraries"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for generic U-Boot libraries within SPL. These
	  libraries include generic code to deal with device tree, hashing,
	  printf(), compression and the like. This option is enabled on many
	  boards. Enable this option to build the code in lib/ as part of an
	  SPL build.

config SPL_MMC_SUPPORT
	bool "Support MMC"
	depends on SPL && GENERIC_MMC
	help
	  Enable support for MMC (Multimedia Card) within SPL. This enables
	  the MMC protocol implementation and allows any enabled drivers to
	  be used within SPL. MMC can be used with or without disk partition
	  support depending on the application (SPL_LIBDISK_SUPPORT). Enable
	  this option to build the drivers in drivers/mmc as part of an SPL
	  build.

config SPL_MPC8XXX_INIT_DDR_SUPPORT
	bool "Support MPC8XXX DDR init"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for DDR-SDRAM (double-data-rate synchronous dynamic
	  random-access memory) on the MPC8XXX family within SPL. This
	  allows DRAM to be set up before loading U-Boot into that DRAM,
	  where it can run.

config SPL_MTD_SUPPORT
	bool "Support MTD drivers"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for MTD (Memory Technology Device) within SPL. MTD
	  provides a block interface over raw NAND and can also be used with
	  SPI flash. This allows SPL to load U-Boot from supported MTD
	  devices. See SPL_NAND_SUPPORT and SPL_ONENAND_SUPPORT for how
	  to enable specific MTD drivers.

config SPL_MUSB_NEW_SUPPORT
	bool "Support new Mentor Graphics USB"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for Mentor Graphics USB in SPL. This is a new
	  driver used by some boards. Enable this option to build
	  the drivers in drivers/usb/musb-new as part of an SPL build. The
	  old drivers are in drivers/usb/musb.

config SPL_NAND_SUPPORT
	bool "Support NAND flash"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for NAND (Negative AND) flash in SPL. NAND flash
	  can be used to allow SPL to load U-Boot from supported devices.
	  This enables the drivers in drivers/mtd/nand as part of an SPL
	  build.

config SPL_NET_SUPPORT
	bool "Support networking"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for network devices (such as Ethernet) in SPL.
	  This permits SPL to load U-Boot over a network link rather than
	  from an on-board peripheral. Environment support is required since
	  the network stack uses a number of environment variables. See also
	  SPL_ETH_SUPPORT.

if SPL_NET_SUPPORT
config SPL_NET_VCI_STRING
	string "BOOTP Vendor Class Identifier string sent by SPL"
	help
	  As defined by RFC 2132 the vendor class identifier field can be
	  sent by the client to identify the vendor type and configuration
	  of a client.  This is often used in practice to allow for the DHCP
	  server to specify different files to load depending on if the ROM,
	  SPL or U-Boot itself makes the request
endif   # if SPL_NET_SUPPORT

config SPL_NO_CPU_SUPPORT
	bool "Drop CPU code in SPL"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  This is specific to the ARM926EJ-S CPU. It disables the standard
	  start.S start-up code, presumably so that a replacement can be
	  used on that CPU. You should not enable it unless you know what
	  you are doing.

config SPL_NOR_SUPPORT
	bool "Support NOR flash"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for loading U-Boot from memory-mapped NOR (Negative
	  OR) flash in SPL. NOR flash is slow to write but fast to read, and
	  a memory-mapped device makes it very easy to access. Loading from
	  NOR is typically achieved with just a memcpy().

config SPL_ONENAND_SUPPORT
	bool "Support OneNAND flash"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for OneNAND (Negative AND) flash in SPL. OneNAND is
	  a type of NAND flash and therefore can be used to allow SPL to
	  load U-Boot from supported devices. This enables the drivers in
	  drivers/mtd/onenand as part of an SPL build.

config SPL_OS_BOOT

config SPL_PCI_SUPPORT
	bool "Support PCI drivers"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for PCI in SPL. For platforms that need PCI to boot,
	  or must perform some init using PCI in SPL, this provides the
	  necessary driver support. This enables the drivers in drivers/pci
	  as part of an SPL build.

config SPL_PCH_SUPPORT
	bool "Support PCH drivers"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for PCH (Platform Controller Hub) devices in SPL.
	  These are used to set up GPIOs and the SPI peripheral early in
	  boot. This enables the drivers in drivers/pch as part of an SPL
	  build.

config SPL_POST_MEM_SUPPORT
	bool "Support POST drivers"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for POST (Power-on Self Test) in SPL. POST is a
	  procedure that checks that the hardware (CPU or board) appears to
	  be functionally correctly. It is a sanity check that can be
	  performed before booting. This enables the drivers in post/drivers
	  as part of an SPL build.

config SPL_POWER_SUPPORT
	bool "Support power drivers"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for power control in SPL. This includes support
	  for PMICs (Power-management Integrated Circuits) and some of the
	  features provided by PMICs. In particular, voltage regulators can
	  be used to enable/disable power and vary its voltage. That can be
	  useful in SPL to turn on boot peripherals and adjust CPU voltage
	  so that the clock speed can be increased. This enables the drivers
	  in drivers/power, drivers/power/pmic and drivers/power/regulator
	  as part of an SPL build.

config SPL_RAM_SUPPORT
	bool "Support booting from RAM"
	depends on SPL
	default y if MICROBLAZE || ARCH_SOCFPGA || TEGRA || ARCH_ZYNQ
	help
	  Enable booting of an image in RAM. The image can be preloaded or

config SPL_RAM_DEVICE
	bool "Support booting from preloaded image in RAM"
	depends on SPL_RAM_SUPPORT
	default y if MICROBLAZE || ARCH_SOCFPGA || TEGRA || ARCH_ZYNQ
	help
	  Enable booting of an image already loaded in RAM. The image has to
	  be already in memory when SPL takes over, e.g. loaded by the boot
	  ROM.

config SPL_RTC_SUPPORT
	bool "Support RTC drivers"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable RTC (Real-time Clock) support in SPL. This includes support
	  for reading and setting the time. Some RTC devices also have some
	  non-volatile (battery-backed) memory which is accessible if
	  needed. This enables the drivers in drivers/rtc as part of an SPL
	  build.

config SPL_SATA_SUPPORT
	bool "Support loading from SATA"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for SATA (Serial AT attachment) in SPL. This allows
	  use of SATA devices such as hard drives and flash drivers for
	  loading U-Boot. SATA is used in higher-end embedded systems and
	  can provide higher performance than MMC , at somewhat higher
	  expense and power consumption. This enables loading from SATA
	  using a configured device.

config SPL_SERIAL_SUPPORT
	bool "Support serial"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for serial in SPL. This allows use of a serial UART
	  for displaying messages while SPL is running. It also brings in
	  printf() and panic() functions. This should normally be enabled
	  unless there are space reasons not to. Even then, consider
	  enabling USE_TINY_PRINTF which is a small printf() version.

config SPL_SPI_FLASH_SUPPORT
	bool "Support SPI flash drivers"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for using SPI flash in SPL, and loading U-Boot from
	  SPI flash. SPI flash (Serial Peripheral Bus flash) is named after
	  the SPI bus that is used to connect it to a system. It is a simple
	  but fast bidirectional 4-wire bus (clock, chip select and two data
	  lines). This enables the drivers in drivers/mtd/spi as part of an
	  SPL build. This normally requires SPL_SPI_SUPPORT.

config SPL_SPI_SUPPORT
	bool "Support SPI drivers"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for using SPI in SPL. This is used for connecting
	  to SPI flash for loading U-Boot. See SPL_SPI_FLASH_SUPPORT for
	  more details on that. The SPI driver provides the transport for
	  data between the SPI flash and the CPU. This option can be used to
	  enable SPI drivers that are needed for other purposes also, such
	  as a SPI PMIC.

config SPL_TIMER_SUPPORT
	bool "Support timer drivers"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable support for timer drivers in SPL. These can be used to get
	  a timer value when in SPL, or perhaps for implementing a delay
	  function. This enables the drivers in drivers/timer as part of an
	  SPL build.

config SPL_USB_HOST_SUPPORT
	bool "Support USB host drivers"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Enable access to USB (Universal Serial Bus) host devices so that
	  SPL can load U-Boot from a connected USB peripheral, such as a USB
	  flash stick. While USB takes a little longer to start up than most
	  buses, it is very flexible since many different types of storage
	  device can be attached. This option enables the drivers in
	  drivers/usb/host as part of an SPL build.

config SPL_USB_SUPPORT
	bool "Support loading from USB"
	depends on SPL_USB_HOST_SUPPORT
	help
	  Enable support for USB devices in SPL. This allows use of USB
	  devices such as hard drives and flash drivers for loading U-Boot.
	  The actual drivers are enabled separately using the normal U-Boot
	  config options. This enables loading from USB using a configured
	  device.

config SPL_USB_GADGET_SUPPORT

if SPL_USB_GADGET_SUPPORT

config SPL_USBETH_SUPPORT
	bool "Support USB Ethernet drivers"
	help
	  Enable access to the USB network subsystem and associated
	  drivers in SPL. This permits SPL to load U-Boot over a
	  USB-connected Ethernet link (such as a USB Ethernet dongle) rather
	  than from an onboard peripheral. Environment support is required
	  since the network stack uses a number of environment variables.
