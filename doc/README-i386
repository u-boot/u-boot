This is my attempt to port U-Boot to the i386 platform. This
work was sponsored by my emplyer, Omicron Ceti AB. http://www.omicron.se

It is currently capable of booting a linux bzImage from flash on
the AMD SC520 CDP platform.

It was originally based on PPCBoot taken from the CVS October 28 2002.

To compile:

1) Unpack the source tree, either from the complete tarball or
   from the virgin snapshot + the patch

2) Configure the source
   $ make sc520_cdp_comfig
   $ make

To use this code on the CDP:
1) Make a suitable kernel, I used 2.4.19 with the mtd-support updated
   from the MTD CVS and a patch to allow root=/dev/mtdblock1 which I
   included at the end of this file.
   The following options in the MTD section might be useful:

   CONFIG_MTD_PHYSMAP=y
   CONFIG_MTD_PHYSMAP_START=38100000
   CONFIG_MTD_PHYSMAP_LEN=7a0000
   CONFIG_MTD_PHYSMAP_BUSWIDTH=2


2) Program it in to the CDP flashbank with remon
   u-boot.bin should be programmed att offset 0x7e000 and the kernel at
   offset 0. If you want to use a jffs2 root file system (not included here),
   it should be  programmed to offset 0x100000.

   remon> z
   remon> yi
   remon> ns u-boot.bin 7e0000
   remon> ns bzImage 0
   remon> ns image.jffs2 100000

3) Connect a terminal to the 25pin serial port at 9600bps, and start the CDP.

   remon> z
   remon> g

4) U-Boot should output some message and a prompt on the terminal, to
   start the kernel issue the following command:

   BOOT> bootm

5) The kernel should boot, and mount the root filesystem if present.

We hope you find this stuff useful
