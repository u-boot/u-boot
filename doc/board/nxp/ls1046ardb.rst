Booting Options
---------------

NB: The reference manual documents the RCW source with the *least-significant
bit first*.

QSPI boot
^^^^^^^^^

This is the default. ``{ SW5[0:8], SW4[0] }`` should be ``0010_0010_0``.

SD boot and eMMC boot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``{ SW5[0:8], SW4[0] }`` should be ``0010_0000_0``. eMMC is selected only if
there is no SD card in the slot.

.. _ls1046ardb_jtag:

JTAG boot
^^^^^^^^^

To recover a bricked board, or to perform initial programming, the ls1046
supports using two hard-coded Reset Configuration Words (RCWs). Unfortunately,
this configuration disables most functionality, including the uarts and ethernet.
However, the SD/MMC and flash controllers are still functional. To get around
the lack of a serial console, we will use ARM semihosting instead. When
enabled, OpenOCD will interpret certain instructions as calls to the host
operating system. This allows U-Boot to use the console, read/write files, or
run arbitrary commands (!).

When configuring U-Boot, ensure that ``CONFIG_SEMIHOSTING``,
``CONFIG_SPL_SEMIHOSTING``, and ``CONFIG_SEMIHOSTING_SERIAL`` are enabled.
``{ SW5[0:8], SW4[0] }`` should be ``0100_1111_0``. Additionally, ``SW4[7]``
should be set to ``0``. Connect to the "console" USB connector on the front of
the enclosure.

Create a new file called ``u-boot.tcl`` (or whatever you choose) with the
following contents::

    # Load the configuration for the LS1046ARDB
    source [find board/nxp_rdb-ls1046a.cfg]
    # Initialize the scan chain
    init
    # Stop the processor
    halt
    # Enable semihosting
    arm semihosting enable
    # Load U-Boot SPL
    load_image spl/u-boot-spl 0 elf
    # Start executing SPL at the beginning of OCRAM
    resume 0x10000000

Then, launch openocd like::

    openocd -f u-boot.tcl

You should see the U-boot SPL banner followed by the banner for U-Boot proper
in the output of openocd. The CMSIS-DAP adapter is slow, so this can take a
long time. If you don't see it, something has gone wrong. After a while, you
should see the prompt. You can load an image using semihosting by running::

    => load hostfs - $loadaddr <name of file>

Note that openocd's terminal is "cooked," so commands will only be sent to
U-Boot when you press enter, and all commands will be echoed twice.
Additionally, openocd will block when waiting for input, ignoring gdb, JTAG
events, and Ctrl-Cs. To make openocd process these events, just hit enter.

Using an external JTAG adapter
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The CMSIS-DAP adapter can be rather slow. To speed up booting, use an external
JTAG adapter. The following examples assume you are using a J-Link, though any
adapter supported by OpenOCD will do. Ensure that ``SW4[7]`` is ``1``. Attach
your jtag adapter to J22. Modify ``u-boot.tcl`` and replace the first two lines
with the following::

    # Load the J-Link configuration (or whatever your adapter is)
    source [find interface/jlink.cfg]
    # Use JTAG, since the J-Link also supports SWD
    transport select jtag
    # The reset pin resets the whole CPU
    reset_config srst_only
    # Load the LS1046A config
    source [find target/ls1046a.cfg]

You can proceed as normal through the rest of the steps above. I got a speedup
of around 100x by using a J-Link.

Debug UART
----------

To enable the debug UART, enable the following config options::

    CONFIG_DEBUG_UART_NS16550=y
    CONFIG_DEBUG_UART_BASE=0x21c0500
    CONFIG_DEBUG_UART_CLOCK=300000000
