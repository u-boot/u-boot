Release Cycle
=============

The U-Boot projects attempts to maintain a fixed, predictable Release
Cycle as follows:

* We will have U-Boot releases at a fixed release interval of (approximately)
  every 3 months.

* Under normal conditions the release date will be the first Monday of the month.

* Immediately following each release, there will be a "merge window" of
  normally 21 days, i. e. if the release was on a Monday, then the merge window
  will close on the Monday in the 3rd week after the release.

  While this merge window is open, new features can be added to the U-Boot
  source tree. This is further expanded on in the :doc:`process`.

* After the merge window closes, no new features may be added to allow for a
  release candidate phase which is intended to fix bugs and regressions.

* To help with late pull requests, the **next** branch will open when the
  second release candidate is published.

*Note:* While we try to adhere to the release schedule, we will
not hesitate and take the liberty to delay a release if there are
good reasons, for example if there are known bugs or other technical
reasons.  The code will be released when it is considered ready
without caring too much about the announced deadline.

*Note 2:* Even though we follow Linux ways in many respects, there are
differences in the actual procedures, which are documented in the
:doc:`process`.

Version Numbers
---------------

Starting with the release in October 2008, the names of the releases were
changed from numerical release numbers without deeper meaning into a time stamp
based numbering.  Regular releases are now identified by names consisting of
the calendar year and month of the release date.  Additional fields are
frequently used to denote the release candidates.  They are also used on rare
occasions to note a bug fix release on top of the previous stable release.

Examples::

  U-Boot v2009.11	- Release November 2009
  U-Boot v2009.11.1	- Bug fix release 1 on top of the November 2009 release
  U-Boot v2010.09-rc1   - Release candidate 1 for September 2010 release
