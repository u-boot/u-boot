* Intel Advanced Configuration and Power Interface General Purpose Events

This describes an interrupt controller which provides access to GPEs supported
by the SoC.

Required properties:

- compatible : "intel,acpi-gpe"
- interrupt-controller : Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells : The number of cells to define the interrupts.  Must be 2:
     cell 0: interrupt number (normally >=32 since GPEs below that are reserved)
     cell 1: 0 (flags, but none are currently defined)
- reg : The register bank for the controller (set this to the ACPI base).

Example:

	general-purpose-events {
		reg = <IOMAP_ACPI_BASE IOMAP_ACPI_SIZE>;
		compatible = "intel,acpi-gpe";
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
	};

	...
	tpm@50 {
		reg = <0x50>;
		compatible = "google,cr50";
		ready-gpio = <&gpio_n 0x1c GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		interrupts-extended = <&acpi_gpe 0x3c 0>;
	};
