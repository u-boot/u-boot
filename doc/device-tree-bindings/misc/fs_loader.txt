* File system firmware loader

Required properties:
--------------------

- compatible: should contain "u-boot,fs-loader"
- phandlepart: which block storage device and partition the image loading from,
	       this property is required for mmc, usb and sata. This is unsigned
	       32-bit array. For example phandlepart=<&mmc_0 1>, meaning use
	       that MMC0 node pointer, partition 1.
- mdtpart: which partition of ubi the image loading from, this property is
	   required for ubi and mounting.
- ubivol: which volume of ubi the image loading from, this property is required
	  for ubi and mounting.
- sfconfig: serial flash configuration which should only contain "bus number"
	    and "chip selection". Note that using this configuration selects
	    RAW data partition as default which doesn't have built-in data
	    integrity support.

Example of storage device and partition search set for mmc, usb, sata and
ubi in device tree source as shown in below:

	Example of storage type and device partition search set for mmc, usb,
	sata and ubi as shown in below:
	Example for mmc:
	fs_loader0: fs-loader@0 {
		bootph-all;
		compatible = "u-boot,fs-loader";
		phandlepart = <&mmc_0 1>;
	};

	Example for usb:
	fs_loader1: fs-loader@1 {
		bootph-all;
		compatible = "u-boot,fs-loader";
		phandlepart = <&usb0 1>;
	};

	Example for sata:
	fs_loader2: fs-loader@2 {
		bootph-all;
		compatible = "u-boot,fs-loader";
		phandlepart = <&sata0 1>;
	};

	Example for ubi:
	fs_loader3: fs-loader@3 {
		bootph-all;
		compatible = "u-boot,fs-loader";
		mtdpart = "UBI",
		ubivol = "ubi0";
	};

	Example for qspi:
	fs_loader4: fs-loader@4 {
		bootph-all;
		compatible = "u-boot,fs-loader";
		sfconfig = <0 0>;
	};
