Common MDIO bus properties.

These are generic properties that can apply to any MDIO bus.

Optional properties:
	- device-name - If present it is used to name the device and MDIO bus.
			The name must be unique and must not contain spaces.

A list of child nodes, one per device on the bus is expected.  These could be
PHYs, switches or similar devices and child nodes should follow the specific
binding for the device type.

Example :
This example shows the structure used for the external MDIO bus on NXP LS1028A
RDB board.  Note that this MDIO device is an integrated PCI function and
requires no compatible property for probing.
