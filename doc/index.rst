The U-Boot Documentation
========================

This is the top level of the U-Boot's documentation tree.  U-Boot
documentation, like the U-Boot itself, is very much a work in progress;
that is especially true as we work to integrate our many scattered
documents into a coherent whole.  Please note that improvements to the
documentation are welcome; join the U-Boot list at http://lists.denx.de
if you want to help out.

Driver-Model documentation
--------------------------
The following holds information on the U-Boot device driver framework:
driver-model, including the design details of itself and several driver
subsystems.

U-Boot API documentation
------------------------

These books get into the details of how specific U-Boot subsystems work
from the point of view of a U-Boot developer.  Much of the information here
is taken directly from the U-Boot source, with supplemental material added
as needed (or at least as we managed to add it - probably *not* all that is
needed).
