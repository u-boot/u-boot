bind command
============

Synopsis
--------

::

    bind <node path> <driver>
    bind <class> <seq> <driver>

Description
-----------

The bind command is used to bind a device to a driver. This makes the
device available in U-Boot.

While binding to a *node path* typically provides a working device
binding by parent node and driver may lead to a device that is only
partially initialized.

node path
    path of the device's device-tree node

class
    device class name

seq
    sequence number of the parent device in the device class

driver
    device driver name

Example
-------

Given a system with a real time clock device with device path */pl031@9010000*
and using driver rtc-pl031 unbinding and binding of the device is demonstrated
using the two alternative bind syntaxes.

Obviously the device is not initialized correctly by the last bind command.

Configuration
-------------

The bind command is only available if CONFIG_CMD_BIND=y.

Return code
-----------

The return code $? is 0 (true) on success and 1 (false) on failure.
