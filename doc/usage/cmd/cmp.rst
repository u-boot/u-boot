cmp command
===========

Synopsis
--------

::

    cmp [.b, .w, .l, .q] addr1 addr2 count

Description
-----------

The cmp command is used to compare two memory areas. By default it works on
four byte (32-bit) values. By appending .b, .w, .l, .q the size of the
values is controlled:

cmp.b
    compare 1 byte (8-bit) values

cmp.w
    compare 2 byte (16-bit) values

cmp.l
    compare 4 byte (32-bit) values

cmp.q
    compare 8 byte (64-bit) values

The parameters are used as follows:

addr1
    Address of the first memory area.

addr2
    Address of the second memory area.

count
    Number of bytes to compare (as hexadecimal number).

Example
-------

In the example below the strings "Hello world\n" and "Hello World\n" are written
to memory and then compared.

Configuration
-------------

The cmp command is only available if CONFIG_CMD_MEMORY=y. The cmp.q command is
only available if additionally CONFIG_MEM_SUPPORT_64BIT_DATA=y.

Return value
------------

The return value $? is true (0) if the compared memory areas are equal.
The reutrn value is false (1) if the compared memory areas differ.
