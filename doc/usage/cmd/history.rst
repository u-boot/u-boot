history command
===============

Synopis
-------

::

    history

Description
-----------

The *history* command shows a list of previously entered commands on the
command line. When U-Boot starts, this it is initially empty. Each new command
entered is added to the list.

Normally these commands can be accessed by pressing the `up arrow` and
`down arrow` keys, which cycle through the list. The `history` command provides
a simple way to view the list.

Example
-------

This example shows entering three commands, then `history`. Note that `history`
itself is added to the list.
