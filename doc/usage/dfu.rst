Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU)
=============================

Overview
--------

Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) enables the download and upload of firmware
to/from U-Boot while connected over USB.

U-Boot follows the Universal Serial Bus Device Class Specification for
Device Firmware Upgrade Version 1.1 from the USB forum (DFU v1.1 in www.usb.org).

U-Boot implements this DFU capability (CONFIG_DFU) with the command dfu
(cmd/dfu.c / CONFIG_CMD_DFU) based on:

- the DFU stack (common/dfu.c and common/spl/spl_dfu.c), based on the
  USB DFU download gadget (drivers/usb/gadget/f_dfu.c)
- The access to mediums is done in DFU backends (driver/dfu)

Today the supported DFU backends are:

- MMC (RAW or FAT / EXT2 / EXT3 / EXT4 file system / SKIP / SCRIPT)
- SCSI (UFS, RAW partition, FAT / EXT2 / EXT3 / EXT4 file system / SKIP / SCRIPT)
- NAND
- RAM
- SF (serial flash)
- MTD (all MTD device: NAND, SPI-NOR, SPI-NAND,...)
- virtual

These DFU backends are also used by

- the dfutftp (see README.dfutftp)
- the thordown command (cmd/thordown.c and gadget/f_thor.c)

The "virtual" backend is a generic DFU backend to support a board specific
target (for example OTP), only based on the weak functions:

- dfu_write_medium_virt
- dfu_get_medium_size_virt
- dfu_read_medium_virt

Configuration Options
---------------------

The following configuration options are relevant to device firmware upgrade:

* CONFIG_DFU
* CONFIG_DFU_OVER_USB
* CONFIG_DFU_MMC
* CONFIG_DFU_MTD
* CONFIG_DFU_NAND
* CONFIG_DFU_RAM
* CONFIG_DFU_SCSI
* CONFIG_DFU_SF
* CONFIG_DFU_SF_PART
* CONFIG_DFU_TIMEOUT
* CONFIG_DFU_VIRTUAL
* CONFIG_CMD_DFU

Environment variables
---------------------

The dfu command uses 3 environment variables:

dfu_alt_info
    The DFU setting for the USB download gadget with a semicolon separated
    string of information on each alternate::

        dfu_alt_info="<alt1>;<alt2>;....;<altN>"

    When several devices are used, the format is:

    - <interface> <dev>'='alternate list (';' separated)
    - each interface is separated by '&'::

        dfu_alt_info=\
            "<interface1> <dev1>=<alt1>;....;<altN>&"\
            "<interface2> <dev2>=<altN+1>;....;<altM>&"\
            ...\
            "<interfaceI> <devI>=<altY+1>;....;<altZ>&"

dfu_bufsiz
    size of the DFU buffer, when absent, defaults to
    CONFIG_SYS_DFU_DATA_BUF_SIZE (8 MiB by default)

dfu_hash_algo
    name of the hash algorithm to use

Commands
--------

dfu <USB_controller> [<interface> <dev>] list
    List the alternate device defined in *dfu_alt_info*.

dfu <USB_controller> [<interface> <dev>] [<timeout>]
    Start the dfu stack on the USB instance with the selected medium
    backend and use the *dfu_alt_info* variable to configure the
    alternate setting and link each one with the medium.
    The dfu command continues until it receives a ^C in the console or
    a DFU detach transaction from the HOST. If the CONFIG_DFU_TIMEOUT option
    is enabled and a <timeout> parameter is present in the command line,
    the DFU operation will be aborted automatically after <timeout>
    seconds of waiting for the remote to initiate a DFU session.

The possible values of <interface> are (with <USB controller> = 0 in the dfu
command example)

mmc
    for eMMC and SD card::

        dfu 0 mmc <dev>

    each element in *dfu_alt_info* being

    * <name> raw <offset> <size> [mmcpart <num>]   raw access to mmc device
    * <name> part <dev> <part_id> [offset <byte>]  raw access to partition
    * <name> fat <dev> <part_id>                   file in FAT partition
    * <name> ext4 <dev> <part_id>                  file in EXT4 partition
    * <name> skip 0 0                              ignore flashed data
    * <name> script 0 0                            execute commands in shell

    with

    offset
        is the offset in the device (hexadecimal without "0x")
    size
        is the size of the access area (hexadecimal without "0x")
        or 0 which means whole device
    partid
        being the GPT or DOS partition index,
    num
         being the eMMC hardware partition number.

    A value of environment variable *dfu_alt_info* for eMMC could be::

        u-boot raw 0x3e 0x800 mmcpart 1;bl2 raw 0x1e 0x1d mmcpart 1

    A value of environment variable *dfu_alt_info* for SD card could be::

        u-boot raw 0x80 0x800;uImage ext4 0 2

    If you don't want to flash the given image file to storage, use the "skip"
    type entity.

    - It can be used to protect from flashing the wrong image for the specific board.
    - Especially, this layout will be useful when the thor protocol is used,
      which performs flashing in batch mode, where more than one file is
      processed.

    For example, if one makes a single tar file with support for the two
    boards with u-boot-<board1>.bin and u-boot-<board2>.bin files, one
    can use it to flash a proper u-boot image on both without a failure::

        u-boot-<board1>.bin raw 0x80 0x800; u-boot-<board2>.bin skip 0 0

    When flashing a new system image requires you to do some more complex
    things than just writing data to the storage medium, one can use 'script'
    type. Data written to such an entity will be executed as a command list
    in the u-boot's shell. This for example allows you to re-create a partition
    layout and even set a new *dfu_alt_info* for the newly created partitions.
    Such a script would look like::

        setenv dfu_alt_info ...
        setenv mbr_parts ...
        mbr write ...

    Please note that this means the user will be able to execute any
    arbitrary commands just like in the u-boot's shell.

    for UFS storage::

        dfu 0 scsi <dev>

    each element in *dfu_alt_info* being

    * <name> fat <part_id>           file in FAT partition
    * <name> ext4 <part_id>          file in EXT4 partition
    * <name> skip 0 0                ignore flashed data
    * <name> script 0 0              execute commands in shell

    with

    size
        is the size of the access area (hexadecimal without "0x")

    A value of environment variable *dfu_alt_info* for UFS could be::

    mtd <dev>=<alt1>;....;<altN>
    virt <dev>=<alt1>;....;<altN>

Callbacks
---------

The weak callback functions can be implemented to manage specific behavior

dfu_initiated_callback
   called when the DFU transaction is started, used to initialize the device

dfu_flush_callback
    called at the end of the DFU write after DFU manifestation, used to manage
    the device when the DFU transaction is closed

Host tools
----------

When U-Boot runs the dfu stack, the DFU host tools can be used
to send/receive firmware images on each configured alternate.

For example dfu-util is a host side implementation of the DFU 1.1
specifications(http://dfu-util.sourceforge.net/) which works with U-Boot.

Usage
-----

Example 1: firmware located in eMMC or SD card, with:

- alternate 1 (alt=1) for SPL partition (GPT partition 1)
- alternate 2 (alt=2) for U-Boot partition (GPT partition 2)

The U-Boot configuration is::

  U-Boot> env set dfu_alt_info "spl part 0 1;u-boot part 0 2"

  U-Boot> dfu 0 mmc 0 list
  DFU alt settings list:
  dev: eMMC alt: 0 name: spl layout: RAW_ADDR
  dev: eMMC alt: 1 name: u-boot layout: RAW_ADDR

  Boot> dfu 0 mmc 0

On the Host side:

list the available alternate setting::

  $> dfu-util -l
  dfu-util 0.9
