	help
	  This enables a uclass for disk controllers in U-Boot. Various driver
	  types can use this, such as AHCI/SATA. It does not provide any standard
	  operations at present. The block device interface has not been converted
	  to driver model.

config SATA
	bool "Support SATA controllers"
	help
	  This enables support for SATA (Serial Advanced Technology
	  Attachment), a serial bus standard for connecting to hard drives and
	  other storage devices.

	  SATA replaces PATA (originally just ATA), which stands for Parallel AT
	  Attachment, where AT refers to an IBM AT (Advanced Technology)
	  computer released in 1984.

	  See also CMD_SATA which provides command-line support.

config LIBATA

	help
	  Select this to build and link the libata helper functions.

config SCSI_AHCI
	bool "Enable SCSI interface to SATA devices"
	select LIBATA
