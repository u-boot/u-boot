	select BLK
	help
	  This enables support for SATA (Serial Advanced Technology
	  Attachment), a serial bus standard for connecting to hard drives and
	  other storage devices.

	  SATA replaces PATA (originally just ATA), which stands for Parallel AT
	  Attachment, where AT refers to an IBM AT (Advanced Technology)
	  computer released in 1984.

	  See also CMD_SATA which provides command-line support.
