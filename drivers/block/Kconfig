config BLK
	bool "Support block devices"
	depends on DM
	default y if DM_MMC
	help
	  Enable support for block devices, such as SCSI, MMC and USB
	  flash sticks. These provide a block-level interface which permits
	  reading, writing and (in some cases) erasing blocks. Block
	  devices often have a partition table which allows the device to
	  be partitioned into several areas, called 'partitions' in U-Boot.
	  A filesystem can be placed in each partition.

config AHCI
	bool "Support SATA controllers with driver model"
	depends on DM
	help
	  This enables a uclass for disk controllers in U-Boot. Various driver
	  types can use this, such as AHCI/SATA. It does not provide any standard
	  operations at present. The block device interface has not been converted
	  to driver model.

config DM_SCSI
	bool "Support SCSI controllers with driver model"
	depends on BLK
	help
	  This option enables the SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) uclass
	  which supports SCSI and SATA HDDs. For every device configuration
	  (IDs/LUNs) a block device is created with RAW read/write and
	  filesystem support.

config BLOCK_CACHE
	bool "Use block device cache"
	default n
	help
	  This option enables a disk-block cache for all block devices.
	  This is most useful when accessing filesystems under U-Boot since
	  it will prevent repeated reads from directory structures and other
	  filesystem data structures.

config SATA_CEVA
	bool "Ceva Sata controller"
	depends on AHCI
	depends on DM_SCSI
	help
	  This option enables Ceva Sata controller hard IP available on Xilinx
	  ZynqMP. Support up to 2 external devices. Complient with SATA 3.1 and
	  AHCI 1.3 specifications with hot-plug detect feature.
