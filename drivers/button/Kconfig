config BUTTON
	bool "Enable button support"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Many boards have buttons which can be used to change behaviour (reset, ...).
	  U-Boot provides a uclass API to implement this feature. Button drivers
	  can provide access to board-specific buttons. Use of the device tree
	  for configuration is encouraged.

config BUTTON_REMAP_PHONE_KEYS
	bool "Remap phone keys for navigation"
	depends on BUTTON
	help
	  Enable remapping of phone keys to navigation keys. This is useful for

	  - Volume up: Up
	  - Volume down: Down
	  - Power: Enter

config BUTTON_ADC
	bool "Button adc"
	depends on BUTTON
	depends on ADC
	help
	  Enable support for buttons which are connected to Analog to Digital
	  Converter device. The ADC driver must use driver model. Buttons are

config BUTTON_GPIO
	bool "Button gpio"
	depends on BUTTON
	depends on DM_GPIO
	help
	  Enable support for buttons which are connected to GPIO lines. These
	  GPIOs may be on the SoC or some other device which provides GPIOs.

config BUTTON_QCOM_PMIC
	bool "Qualcomm power button"
	depends on BUTTON
	depends on PMIC_QCOM
	help
	  Enable support for the power and "resin" (usually volume down) buttons
	  on Qualcomm SoCs. These will be configured as the Enter and Down keys
	  respectively, allowing navigation of bootmenu with buttons on device.
