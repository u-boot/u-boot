config CLK
	bool "Enable clock driver support"
	depends on DM
	help
	  This allows drivers to be provided for clock generators, including
	  oscillators and PLLs. Devices can use a common clock API to request
	  a particular clock rate and check on available clocks. Clocks can
	  feed into other clocks in a tree structure, with multiplexers to
	  choose the source for each clock.

config SPL_CLK
	bool "Enable clock support in SPL"
	depends on CLK && SPL && SPL_DM
	help
	  The clock subsystem adds a small amount of overhead to the image.
	  If this is acceptable and you have a need to use clock drivers in
	  SPL, enable this option. It might provide a cleaner interface to
	  setting up clocks within SPL, and allows the same drivers to be
	  used as U-Boot proper.

config TPL_CLK
	bool "Enable clock support in TPL"
	depends on CLK && TPL_DM
	help
	  The clock subsystem adds a small amount of overhead to the image.
	  If this is acceptable and you have a need to use clock drivers in
	  SPL, enable this option. It might provide a cleaner interface to
	  setting up clocks within TPL, and allows the same drivers to be
	  used as U-Boot proper.

config VPL_CLK
	bool "Enable clock support in VPL"
	depends on CLK && VPL_DM
	help
	  The clock subsystem adds a small amount of overhead to the image.
	  If this is acceptable and you have a need to use clock drivers in
	  SPL, enable this option. It might provide a cleaner interface to
	  setting up clocks within TPL, and allows the same drivers to be
	  used as U-Boot proper.

	  Enable this option to add GPIO-controlled clock gate driver
	  in U-Boot SPL.

config CLK_STUB
	bool "Stub clock driver"
	depends on CLK

	  Enable this to provide a stub clock driver for non-essential clock
	  controllers.

config CLK_BCM6345
	bool "Clock controller driver for BCM6345"

	  Crystal Oscillator). The output frequency can be programmed via an
	  I2C interface.

config CLK_INTEL
	bool "Enable clock driver for Intel x86"
	depends on CLK && X86
	help
	  This provides very basic support for clocks on Intel SoCs. The driver
	  is barely used at present but could be expanded as needs arise.
	  Much clock configuration in U-Boot is either set up by the FSP, or
	  set up by U-Boot itself but only statically. Thus the driver does not
	  support changing clock rates, only querying them.

	  The wizard support for dynamically reconfiguring the clocking
	  primitives for Multiply, Divide, Phase Shift/Offset, or Duty
	  Cycle. Limited by U-Boot clk uclass without set_phase API and
	  set_duty_cycle API, this driver only supports set_rate to modify
