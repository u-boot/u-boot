config CLK
	bool "Enable clock driver support"
	depends on DM
	help
	  This allows drivers to be provided for clock generators, including
	  oscillators and PLLs. Devices can use a common clock API to request
	  a particular clock rate and check on available clocks. Clocks can
	  feed into other clocks in a tree structure, with multiplexers to
	  choose the source for each clock.

config SPL_CLK
	bool "Enable clock support in SPL"
	depends on CLK && SPL && SPL_DM
	help
	  The clock subsystem adds a small amount of overhead to the image.
	  If this is acceptable and you have a need to use clock drivers in
	  SPL, enable this option. It might provide a cleaner interface to
	  setting up clocks within SPL, and allows the same drivers to be
	  used as U-Boot proper.

config TPL_CLK
	bool "Enable clock support in TPL"
	depends on CLK && TPL_DM
	help
	  The clock subsystem adds a small amount of overhead to the image.
	  If this is acceptable and you have a need to use clock drivers in
	  SPL, enable this option. It might provide a cleaner interface to
	  setting up clocks within TPL, and allows the same drivers to be
	  used as U-Boot proper.

config CLK_BCM6345
	bool "Clock controller driver for BCM6345"
	depends on CLK && ARCH_BMIPS
	default y
	help
	  This clock driver adds support for enabling and disabling peripheral
	  clocks on BCM6345 SoCs. HW has no rate changing capabilities.

config CLK_BOSTON
	def_bool y if TARGET_BOSTON
	depends on CLK
	select REGMAP
	select SYSCON
	help
	  Enable this to support the clocks

config CLK_STM32F
	bool "Enable clock driver support for STM32F family"
	depends on CLK && (STM32F7 || STM32F4)
	default y
	help
	  This clock driver adds support for RCC clock management
	  for STM32F4 and STM32F7 SoCs.

config CLK_HSDK
	bool "Enable cgu clock driver for HSDK"
	depends on CLK
	help
	  Enable this to support the cgu clocks on Synopsys ARC HSDK

config CLK_ZYNQ
	bool "Enable clock driver support for Zynq"
	depends on CLK && ARCH_ZYNQ
	default y
	help
	  This clock driver adds support for clock realted settings for
	  Zynq platform.

config CLK_ZYNQMP
	bool "Enable clock driver support for ZynqMP"
	depends on ARCH_ZYNQMP
	help
	  This clock driver adds support for clock realted settings for
	  ZynqMP platform.
