config CPU
	bool "Enable CPU drivers using Driver Model"
	help
	  This allows drivers to be provided for CPUs and their type to be
	  specified in the board's device tree. For boards which support
	  multiple CPUs, then normally have to be set up in U-Boot so that
	  they can work correctly in the OS. This provides a framework for
	  finding out information about available CPUs and making changes.

config CPU_IMX
	bool "Enable i.MX CPU driver"
	depends on CPU && ARM64
	help
	  Support CPU cores for SoCs of the i.MX series.

config CPU_MPC83XX
	bool "Enable MPC83xx CPU driver"
	depends on CPU && MPC83xx
	select CLK_MPC83XX
	help
	  Support CPU cores for SoCs of the MPC83xx series.

config CPU_RISCV
	bool "Enable RISC-V CPU driver"
	depends on CPU && RISCV
	help
	  Support CPU cores for RISC-V architecture.

config CPU_ARMV8
	bool "Enable generic ARMv8 CPU driver"
	depends on CPU && ARM64
	select IRQ
	help
	  Support CPU cores for armv8 architecture.

config CPU_MICROBLAZE
	bool "Enable Microblaze CPU driver"
	depends on CPU && MICROBLAZE
	select DM_EVENT
	select XILINX_MICROBLAZE0_PVR
