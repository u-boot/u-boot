config ASPEED_HACE
	bool "ASPEED Hash and Crypto Engine"
	depends on DM_HASH
	help
	  Select this option to enable a driver for using the SHA engine in
	  the ASPEED BMC SoCs.

	  Enabling this allows the use of SHA operations in hardware without
	  requiring the SHA software implementations. It also improves performance
	  and saves code size.

config ASPEED_ACRY
	bool "ASPEED RSA and ECC Engine"
	depends on ASPEED_AST2600
	help
	 Select this option to enable a driver for using the RSA/ECC engine in
	 the ASPEED BMC SoCs.

	 Enabling this allows the use of RSA/ECC operations in hardware without requiring the
	 software implementations. It also improves performance and saves code size.

config ASPEED_CPTRA_SHA
	bool "Caliptra SHA ACC for Aspeed AST27xx SoCs"
	depends on DM_HASH
	help
	  Select this option to enable a driver for using the SHA accelerator provided
	  by Caliptra 1.0, which is integrated in AST27xx BMC SoCs.

	  Enabling this allows the use of SHA operations in hardware. Note that only
	  SHA384 and SHA512 are supported by Caliptra 1.0.

config ASPEED_CPTRA_ECDSA
	bool "Caliptra ECDSA384 signature verifier for Aspeed SoCs"
	depends on ECDSA_VERIFY || SPL_ECDSA_VERIFY
	help
	  Select this option to enable a driver for using the ECDSA384_SIGNATURE_VERIFY
	  feature of Caliptra, which is integrated in AST27xx BMC SoCs.

	  Enabling this allows the use of ECDSA384 signature verification in hardware.
	  Note that only ECDSA384 is supported by Caliptra.
