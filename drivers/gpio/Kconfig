menuconfig GPIO
	bool "GPIO support"
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for GPIOs (General-purpose Input/Output) in U-Boot.
	  GPIOs allow U-Boot to read the state of an input line (high or
	  low) and set the state of an output line. This can be used to
	  drive LEDs, control power to various system parts and read user
	  input. GPIOs can be useful to enable a 'sign-of-life' LED,
	  for example. Enable this option to build the drivers in
	  drivers/gpio as part of an U-Boot build.
