config DM_I2C
	bool "Enable Driver Model for I2C drivers"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable driver model for I2C. The I2C uclass interface: probe, read,
	  write and speed, is implemented with the bus drivers operations,
	  which provide methods for bus setting and data transfer. Each chip
	  device (bus child) info is kept as parent platdata. The interface
	  is defined in include/i2c.h. When i2c bus driver supports the i2c
	  uclass, but the device drivers not, then DM_I2C_COMPAT config can
	  be used as compatibility layer.

config DM_I2C_COMPAT
	bool "Enable I2C compatibility layer"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable old-style I2C functions for compatibility with existing code.
	  This option can be enabled as a temporary measure to avoid needing
	  to convert all code for a board in a single commit. It should not
	  be enabled for any board in an official release.

config DM_I2C_GPIO
	bool "Enable Driver Model for software emulated I2C bus driver"
	depends on DM_I2C && DM_GPIO
	help
	  Enable the i2c bus driver emulation by using the GPIOs. The bus GPIO
	  configuration is given by the device tree. Kernel-style device tree
	  bindings are supported.
	  Binding info: doc/device-tree-bindings/i2c/i2c-gpio.txt

config SYS_I2C_UNIPHIER
	bool "UniPhier I2C driver"
	depends on ARCH_UNIPHIER && DM_I2C
	default y
	help
	  Support for Panasonic UniPhier I2C controller driver.  This I2C
	  controller is used on PH1-LD4, PH1-sLD8 or older UniPhier SoCs.

config SYS_I2C_UNIPHIER_F
	bool "UniPhier FIFO-builtin I2C driver"
	depends on ARCH_UNIPHIER && DM_I2C
	default y
	help
	  Support for Panasonic UniPhier FIFO-builtin I2C controller driver.
	  This I2C controller is used on PH1-Pro4 or newer UniPhier SoCs.
