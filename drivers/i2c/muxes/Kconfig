config I2C_MUX
	bool "Suport I2C multiplexers"
	depends on DM_I2C
	help
	  This enables I2C buses to be multiplexed, so that you can select
	  one of several buses using some sort of control mechanism. The
	  bus select is handled automatically when that bus is accessed,
	  using a suitable I2C MUX driver.

config I2C_ARB_GPIO_CHALLENGE
        bool "GPIO-based I2C arbitration"
        depends on I2C_MUX
        help
          If you say yes to this option, support will be included for an
          I2C multimaster arbitration scheme using GPIOs and a challenge &
          response mechanism where masters have to claim the bus by asserting
          a GPIO.
