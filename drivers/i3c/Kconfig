	help
	  I3C is a serial protocol standardized by the MIPI alliance.

	  It's supposed to be backward compatible with I2C while providing
	  support for high speed transfers and native interrupt support
	  without the need for extra pins.

	  The I3C protocol also standardizes the slave device types and is
	  mainly designed to communicate with sensors.

	  If you want I3C support, you should say Y here and also to the
	  specific driver for your bus adapter(s) below.
