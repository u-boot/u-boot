config LED
	bool "Enable LED support"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Many boards have LEDs which can be used to signal status or alerts.
	  U-Boot provides a uclass API to implement this feature. LED drivers
	  can provide access to board-specific LEDs. Use of the device tree
	  for configuration is encouraged.

config SPL_LED_SUPPORT
	bool "Enable LED support in SPL"
	depends on LED
	help
	  The LED subsystem adds a small amount of overhead to the image.
	  If this is acceptable and you have a need to use LEDs in SPL,
	  enable this option. You will need to enable device tree in SPL
	  for this to work.

config LED_GPIO
	bool "LED support for GPIO-connected LEDs"
	depends on LED && DM_GPIO
	help
	  Enable support for LEDs which are connected to GPIO lines. These
	  GPIOs may be on the SoC or some other device which provides GPIOs.
	  The GPIO driver must used driver model. LEDs are configured using
	  the device tree.
