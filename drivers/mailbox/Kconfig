config DM_MAILBOX
	bool "Enable mailbox controllers using Driver Model"
	depends on DM && OF_CONTROL
	help
	  Enable support for the mailbox driver class. Mailboxes provide the
	  ability to transfer small messages and/or notifications from one
	  CPU to another CPU, or sometimes to dedicated HW modules. They form
	  the basis of a variety of inter-process/inter-CPU communication
	  protocols.

config APPLE_MBOX
	bool "Enable Apple IOP controller support"
	depends on DM_MAILBOX && ARCH_APPLE
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for the mailboxes that provide a comminucation
	  channel with Apple IOP controllers integrated on Apple SoCs.
	  These IOP controllers are used to implement various functions
	  such as the System Management Controller (SMC) and NVMe and this
	  driver is required to get that functionality up and running.

config IMX_MU_MBOX
	bool "Enable i.MX MU MBOX support"
	depends on DM_MAILBOX
	help
	  Enable support for i.MX Messaging Unit for communication with other
	  processors on the SoC using mailbox interface

config SANDBOX_MBOX
	bool "Enable the sandbox mailbox test driver"
	depends on DM_MAILBOX && SANDBOX
	help
	  Enable support for a test mailbox implementation, which simply echos
	  back a modified version of any message that is sent.

config TEGRA_HSP
	bool "Enable Tegra HSP controller support"
	depends on DM_MAILBOX && ARCH_TEGRA
	help
	  This enables support for the NVIDIA Tegra HSP Hw module, which
	  implements doorbells, mailboxes, semaphores, and shared interrupts.

config STM32_IPCC
	bool "Enable STM32 IPCC controller support"
	depends on DM_MAILBOX && ARCH_STM32MP
	help
	  This enables support for the STM32MP IPCC Hw module, which
	  implements doorbells between 2 processors.

config K3_SEC_PROXY
	bool "Texas Instruments K3 Secure Proxy Driver"
	depends on DM_MAILBOX && ARCH_K3
	help
	  An implementation of Secure proxy slave driver for K3 SoCs from
	  Texas Instruments. Secure proxy is a communication entity mainly
	  used for communication between multiple processors with the SoC.
	  Select this driver if your platform has support for this hardware
	  block.

config ZYNQMP_IPI
	bool "Xilinx ZynqMP IPI controller support"
	depends on DM_MAILBOX && (ARCH_ZYNQMP || ARCH_VERSAL || ARCH_VERSAL_NET || ARCH_VERSAL2)
	help
	  This enables support for the Xilinx ZynqMP Inter Processor Interrupt
	  communication controller.
