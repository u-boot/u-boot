config CMD_CROS_EC
	bool "Enable crosec command"
	depends on CROS_EC
	help
	  Enable command-line access to the Chrome OS EC (Embedded
	  Controller). This provides the 'crosec' command which has
	  a number of sub-commands for performing EC tasks such as
	  updating its flash, accessing a small saved context area
	  and talking to the I2C bus behind the EC (if there is one).

config CROS_EC
	bool "Enable Chrome OS EC"
	help
	  Enable access to the Chrome OS EC. This is a separate
	  microcontroller typically available on a SPI bus on Chromebooks. It
	  provides access to the keyboard, some internal storage and may
	  control access to the battery and main PMIC depending on the
	  device. You can use the 'crosec' command to access it.

config CROS_EC_I2C
	bool "Enable Chrome OS EC I2C driver"
	depends on CROS_EC
	help
	  Enable I2C access to the Chrome OS EC. This is used on older
	  ARM Chromebooks such as snow and spring before the standard bus
	  changed to SPI. The EC will accept commands across the I2C using
	  a special message protocol, and provide responses.

config CROS_EC_LPC
	bool "Enable Chrome OS EC LPC driver"
	depends on CROS_EC
	help
	  Enable I2C access to the Chrome OS EC. This is used on x86
	  Chromebooks such as link and falco. The keyboard is provided
	  through a legacy port interface, so on x86 machines the main
	  function of the EC is power and thermal management.

config CROS_EC_SANDBOX
	bool "Enable Chrome OS EC sandbox driver"
	depends on CROS_EC && SANDBOX
	help
	  Enable a sandbox emulation of the Chrome OS EC. This supports
	  keyboard (use the -l flag to enable the LCD), verified boot context,
	  EC flash read/write/erase support and a few other things. It is
	  enough to perform a Chrome OS verified boot on sandbox.

config CROS_EC_SPI
	bool "Enable Chrome OS EC SPI driver"
	depends on CROS_EC
	help
	  Enable SPI access to the Chrome OS EC. This is used on newer
	  ARM Chromebooks such as pit, pi and nyan-big. The SPI interface
	  provides a faster and more robust interface than I2C but the bugs
	  are less interesting.

config CONFIG_FSL_SEC_MON
	bool "Enable FSL SEC_MON Driver"
	help
	  Freescale Security Monitor block is responsible for monitoring
	  system states.
	  Security Monitor can be transitioned on any security failures,
	  like software violations or hardware security violations.

config PCA9551_LED
	bool "Enable PCA9551 LED driver"
	help
	  Enable driver for PCA9551 LED controller. This controller
	  is connected via I2C. So I2C needs to be enabled.

config PCA9551_I2C_ADDR
	hex "I2C address of PCA9551 LED controller"
	depends on PCA9551_LED
	default 0x60
	help
	  The I2C address of the PCA9551 LED controller.
