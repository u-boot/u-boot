	  When eSDHC operates at 3.3v, damage can accumulate in an internal

	  runs, the more damage accumulates. This issue now is found on LX2160A
	  eSDHC1 for only SD card. The hardware workaround is recommended to use
	  an on-board level shifter that is 1.8v on SoC side and 3.3v on SD card
	  side. For boards without hardware workaround, this option could be
	  enabled, ensuring 1.8v IO voltage and disabling eSDHC if no card.
	  This option assumes no hotplug, and u-boot has to make all the way to
	  to linux to use 1.8v UHS-I speed mode if has card.
