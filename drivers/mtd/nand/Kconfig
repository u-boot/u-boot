config SYS_NAND_SELF_INIT
	bool
	help
	  This option, if enabled, provides more flexible and linux-like
	  NAND initialization process.

config NAND_DENALI
	bool "Support Denali NAND controller"
	select SYS_NAND_SELF_INIT
	help
	  Enable support for the Denali NAND controller.

config SYS_NAND_DENALI_64BIT
	bool "Use 64-bit variant of Denali NAND controller"
	depends on NAND_DENALI
	help
	  The Denali NAND controller IP has some variations in terms of
	  the bus interface.  The DMA setup sequence is completely differenct
	  between 32bit / 64bit AXI bus variants.

	  If your Denali NAND controller is the 64-bit variant, say Y.
	  Otherwise (32 bit), say N.

config NAND_DENALI_SPARE_AREA_SKIP_BYTES
	int "Number of bytes skipped in OOB area"
	depends on NAND_DENALI
	range 0 63
	help
	  This option specifies the number of bytes to skip from the beginning
	  of OOB area before last ECC sector data starts.  This is potentially
	  used to preserve the bad block marker in the OOB area.

config NAND_VF610_NFC
	bool "Support for Freescale NFC for VF610/MPC5125"
	select SYS_NAND_SELF_INIT
	help
	  Enables support for NAND Flash Controller on some Freescale
	  processors like the VF610, MPC5125, MCF54418 or Kinetis K70.
	  The driver supports a maximum 2k page size. The driver
	  currently does not support hardware ECC.

choice
	prompt "Hardware ECC strength"
	depends on NAND_VF610_NFC
	default SYS_NAND_VF610_NFC_45_ECC_BYTES
	help
	  Select the ECC strength used in the hardware BCH ECC block.

config SYS_NAND_VF610_NFC_45_ECC_BYTES
	bool "24-error correction (45 ECC bytes)"

config SYS_NAND_VF610_NFC_60_ECC_BYTES

config NAND_PXA3XX
	bool "Support for NAND on PXA3xx and Armada 370/XP/38x"
	select SYS_NAND_SELF_INIT
	help
	  This enables the driver for the NAND flash device found on
	  PXA3xx processors (NFCv1) and also on Armada 370/XP (NFCv2).

config NAND_SUNXI
	bool "Support for NAND on Allwinner SoCs"
	depends on MACH_SUN4I || MACH_SUN5I || MACH_SUN7I
	select SYS_NAND_SELF_INIT
	---help---
	Enable support for NAND. This option enables the standard and
	SPL drivers.
	The SPL driver only supports reading from the NAND using DMA
	transfers.

config NAND_ARASAN
	bool "Configure Arasan Nand"
	help
	  This enables Nand driver support for Arasan nand flash
	  controller. This uses the hardware ECC for read and
	  write operations.

config NAND_MXS
	bool "MXS NAND support"
	depends on MX6
	help
	  This enables NAND driver for the NAND flash controller on the
	  MXS processors.

config NAND_ZYNQ
	bool "Support for Zynq Nand controller"
	select SYS_NAND_SELF_INIT
	help
	  This enables Nand driver support for Nand flash controller
	  found on Zynq SoC.

# Enhance depends when converting drivers to Kconfig which use this config
# option (mxc_nand, ndfc, omap_gpmc).
config SYS_NAND_BUSWIDTH_16BIT
	bool "Use 16-bit NAND interface"
	depends on NAND_VF610_NFC
	help
	  Indicates that NAND device has 16-bit wide data-bus. In absence of this
	  config, bus-width of NAND device is assumed to be either 8-bit and later
	  determined by reading ONFI params.
	  Above config is useful when NAND device's bus-width information cannot
	  be determined from on-chip ONFI params, like in following scenarios:
	  - SPL boot does not support reading of ONFI parameters. This is done to
	    keep SPL code foot-print small.
	  - In current U-Boot flow using nand_init(), driver initialization
	    happens in board_nand_init() which is called before any device probe
	    (nand_scan_ident + nand_scan_tail), thus device's ONFI parameters are
	    not available while configuring controller. So a static CONFIG_NAND_xx
	    is needed to know the device's bus-width in advance.

config SYS_NAND_U_BOOT_LOCATIONS
	bool "Define U-boot binaries locations in NAND"
	help
	Enable CONFIG_SYS_NAND_U_BOOT_OFFS though Kconfig.
	This option should not be enabled when compiling U-boot for boards
	defining CONFIG_SYS_NAND_U_BOOT_OFFS in their include/configs/<board>.h
	file.

	hex "Location in NAND to read U-Boot from"
	default 0x8000 if NAND_SUNXI

	Set the offset from the start of the nand where u-boot should be
	loaded from.

	hex "Location in NAND to read U-Boot from"
	default SYS_NAND_U_BOOT_OFFS
	depends on SYS_NAND_U_BOOT_LOCATIONS

	Set the offset from the start of the nand where the redundant u-boot
	should be loaded from.

config SPL_NAND_DENALI
	bool "Support Denali NAND controller for SPL"
	help
	  This is a small implementation of the Denali NAND controller
	  for use on SPL.
