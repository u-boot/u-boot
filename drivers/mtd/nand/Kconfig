	help
	  Enable support for the Denali NAND controller.

	bool "Use 64-bit variant of Denali NAND controller"
	depends on NAND_DENALI
	help
	  The Denali NAND controller IP has some variations in terms of
	  the bus interface.  The DMA setup sequence is completely differenct
	  between 32bit / 64bit AXI bus variants.

	  If your Denali NAND controller is the 64-bit variant, say Y.
	  Otherwise (32 bit), say N.

config NAND_DENALI_SPARE_AREA_SKIP_BYTES
	int "Number of bytes skipped in OOB area"
	depends on NAND_DENALI
	range 0 63
	help
	  This option specifies the number of bytes to skip from the beginning
	  of OOB area before last ECC sector data starts.  This is potentially
	  used to preserve the bad block marker in the OOB area.

config SPL_NAND_DENALI
	bool "Support Denali NAND controller for SPL"
	help
	  This is a small implementation of the Denali NAND controller
	  for use on SPL.
