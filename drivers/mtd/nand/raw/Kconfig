	How to select ECC scheme on OMAP and AMxx platforms ?
	-----------------------------------------------------
	Though higher ECC schemes have more capability to detect and correct
	bit-flips, but still selection of ECC scheme is dependent on following
	- hardware engines present in SoC.
		Some legacy OMAP SoC do not have ELM h/w engine thus such
		SoC cannot support BCHx_HW ECC schemes.
	- size of OOB/Spare region
		With higher ECC schemes, more OOB/Spare area is required to
		store ECC. So choice of ECC scheme is limited by NAND oobsize.

	In general following expression can help:
		NAND_OOBSIZE >= 2 + (NAND_PAGESIZE / 512) * ECC_BYTES
	where
		NAND_OOBSIZE	= number of bytes available in
				OOB/spare area per NAND page.
		NAND_PAGESIZE	= bytes in main-area of NAND page.
		ECC_BYTES	= number of ECC bytes generated to
				protect 512 bytes of data, which is:
				3 for HAM1_xx ecc schemes
				7 for BCH4_xx ecc schemes
				14 for BCH8_xx ecc schemes
				26 for BCH16_xx ecc schemes

		example to check for BCH16 on 2K page NAND
		NAND_PAGESIZE = 2048
		NAND_OOBSIZE = 64
		2 + (2048 / 512) * 26 = 106 > NAND_OOBSIZE
		Thus BCH16 cannot be supported on 2K page NAND.

		However, for 4K pagesize NAND
		NAND_PAGESIZE = 4096
		NAND_OOBSIZE = 224
		ECC_BYTES = 26
		2 + (4096 / 512) * 26 = 210 < NAND_OOBSIZE
		Thus BCH16 can be supported on 4K page NAND.
