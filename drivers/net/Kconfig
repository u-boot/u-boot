config DM_ETH
	bool "Enable Driver Model for Ethernet drivers"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable driver model for Ethernet.

	  The eth_*() interface will be implemented by the UC_ETH class
	  This is currently implemented in net/eth.c
	  Look in include/net.h for details.

config PHYLIB
	bool "Ethernet PHY (physical media interface) support"
	help
	  Enable Ethernet PHY (physical media interface) support.

config RTL8211X_PHY_FORCE_MASTER
	bool "Ethernet PHY RTL8211x: force 1000BASE-T master mode"
	depends on PHYLIB
	help
	  Force master mode for 1000BASE-T on RTl8211x PHYs (except for RTL8211F).
	  This can work around link stability and data corruption issues on gigabit
	  links which can occur in slave mode on certain PHYs, e.g. on the
	  RTL8211C(L).

	  Please note that two directly connected devices (i.e. via crossover cable)
	  will not be able to establish a link between each other if they both force
	  master mode. Multiple devices forcing master mode when connected by a
	  network switch do not pose a problem as the switch configures its affected
	  ports into slave mode.

	  This option only affects gigabit links. If you must establish a direct
	  connection between two devices which both force master mode, try forcing
	  the link speed to 100MBit/s.

	  If unsure, say N.

menuconfig NETDEVICES
