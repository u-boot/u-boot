	  used on some devices to allow the CPU to communicate with its
	  peripherals.

	  This subsystem requires driver model.

if PCI

config DM_PCI_COMPAT
	bool "Enable compatible functions for PCI"
	help
	  Enable compatibility functions for PCI so that old code can be used
	  with CONFIG_PCI enabled. This should be used as an interim
	  measure when porting a board to use driver model for PCI. Once the
	  board is fully supported, this option should be disabled.

config SYS_PCI_64BIT
	bool "Enable 64-bit PCI resources"
	default y if PPC

	bool "Enable Multiple entries of region type MEMORY in ranges for PCI"
	help
	  Enable PCI memory regions to be of multiple entry. Multiple entry
