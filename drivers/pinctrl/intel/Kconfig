	  Enable this if the pinctrl devices are modelled as multiple,
	  separate ACPI devices in the ACPI tables. If enabled, the ACPI
	  devices match the U-Boot pinctrl devices and the pin 'offset' is
	  relative to a particular pinctrl device. If disabled, there is a
	  single ACPI pinctrl device which includes all U-Boot pinctrl devices
	  and the pin 'offset' is in effect a global pin number.

	bool "Support Intel Apollo Lake (APL)"
	help
	  Add support for Intel Apollo Lake pin-control and pin-mux settings.
	  These are mostly read from the device tree, with the early-pads
	  property in the host bridge and the pads property in the fsp-s
	  subnode of the host bridge.
