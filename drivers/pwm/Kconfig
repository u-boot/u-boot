config DM_PWM
	bool "Enable support for pulse-width modulation devices (PWM)"
	depends on DM
	help
	  A pulse-width modulator emits a pulse of varying width and provides
	  control over the duty cycle (high and low time) of the signal. This
	  is often used to control a voltage level. The more time the PWM
	  spends in the 'high' state, the higher the voltage. The PWM's
	  frequency/period can be controlled along with the proportion of that
	  time that the signal is high.

config PWM_ROCKCHIP
	bool "Enable support for the Rockchip PWM"
	depends on DM_PWM
	help
	  This PWM is found on RK3288 and other Rockchip SoCs. It supports a
	  programmable period and duty cycle. A 32-bit counter is used.
	  Various options provided in the hardware (such as capture mode and
	  continuous/single-shot) are not supported by the driver.

config PWM_TEGRA
	bool "Enable support for the Tegra PWM"
	depends on DM_PWM
	help
	  This PWM is found on Tegra 20 and other Nvidia SoCs. It supports
	  four channels with a programmable period and duty cycle. Only a
	  32KHz clock is supported by the driver but the duty cycle is
	  configurable.
