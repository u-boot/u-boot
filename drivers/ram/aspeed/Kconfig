	 Configuration options for DDR SDRAM on ASPEED systems.

	 RAM initialisation is always built in for the platform. This menu
	 allows customisation of the configuration used.

	depends on ASPEED_RAM
	help
	 Say Y if dual X8 DDR4 die is used on the board. The ASPEED DDRM
	 SRAM controller needs to know if the memory chip mounted on the
	 board is dual x8 die or not, otherwise it may get the wrong
	 size of the memory space.

	  Say Y here to bypass DRAM self test to speed up the boot time.

config ASPEED_ECC

	help
	  Enable SDRAM ECC function. This configures the SDRAM controller to
	  perform error detection and correction, sacrificing 1/9th of the
	  installed RAM to do so.

	default 0
	help
	  SDRAM size with the error correcting code enabled. The unit is
	  in Megabytes.  Noted that only the 8/9 of the configured size
	  can be used by the system.  The remaining 1/9 will be used by
	  the ECC engine.  If the size is set to 0, the sdram driver will
	  calculate the SDRAM size and set the whole range be ECC enabled.
