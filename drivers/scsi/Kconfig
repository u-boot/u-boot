	  This enables support for SCSI (Small Computer System Interface),
	  a parallel interface widely used with storage peripherals such as
	  hard drives and optical drives. The SCSI standards define physical
	  interfaces as well as protocols for controlling devices and
	  tranferring data. For every device configuration (IDs/LUNs) a block
	  device is created with RAW read/write and filesystem support.
