menuconfig SPI
	bool "SPI Support"
	help
	  The "Serial Peripheral Interface" is a low level synchronous
          protocol.  Chips that support SPI can have data transfer rates
          up to several tens of Mbit/sec.  Chips are addressed with a
          controller and a chipselect.  Most SPI slaves don't support
          dynamic device discovery; some are even write-only or read-only.

          SPI is widely used by microcontrollers to talk with sensors,
          eeprom and flash memory, codecs and various other controller
          chips, analog to digital (and d-to-a) converters, and more.
          MMC and SD cards can be accessed using SPI protocol; and for
          DataFlash cards used in MMC sockets, SPI must always be used.

          SPI is one of a family of similar protocols using a four wire
          interface (select, clock, data in, data out) including Microwire
          (half duplex), SSP, SSI, and PSP.  This driver framework should
          work with most such devices and controllers.

config DM_SPI
	bool "Enable Driver Model for SPI drivers"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable driver model for SPI. The SPI slave interface
	  (spi_setup_slave(), spi_xfer(), etc.) is then implemented by
	  the SPI uclass. Drivers provide methods to access the SPI
	  buses that they control. The uclass interface is defined in
	  include/spi.h. The existing spi_slave structure is attached
	  as 'parent data' to every slave on each bus. Slaves
	  typically use driver-private data instead of extending the
	  spi_slave structure.

config SPI_MEM

	  improvements as it automates the whole process of sending SPI memory
	  operations every time a new region is accessed.
