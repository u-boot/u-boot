	  Support methods to query hardware configurations from internal
	  mechanisms (e.g. reading GPIO values, determining the presence of
	  devices on busses, etc.). This enables the usage of U-Boot with

	help
	  Some boards want to specify the manufacturer or product name but do
	  not need to have their own sysinfo driver. This includes a default
	  one which provides a way to specify this SMBIOS information in the
	  devicetree, without needing any board-specific functionality.
