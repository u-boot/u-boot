	  Enable support for temperature-sensing devices. Some SoCs have on-chip
	  temperature sensors to permit warnings, speed throttling or even
	  automatic power-off when the temperature gets too high or low. Other
	  devices may be discrete but connected on a suitable bus.

	  Support for Temperature Monitor (TEMPMON) found on Freescale i.MX SoCs.
          It supports one critical trip point and one passive trip point.  The
          cpufreq is used as the cooling device to throttle CPUs when the
          passive trip is crossed.
