config TIMER
	bool "Enable driver model for timer drivers"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable driver model for timer access. It uses the same API as
	  lib/time.c, but now implemented by the uclass. The first timer
	  will be used. The timer is usually a 32 bits free-running up
	  counter. There may be no real tick, and no timer interrupt.

config TIMER_EARLY
	bool "Allow timer to be used early in U-Boot"
	depends on TIMER
	help
	  In some cases the timer must be accessible before driver model is
	  active. Examples include when using CONFIG_TRACE to trace U-Boot's
	  execution before driver model is set up. Enable this option to
	  use an early timer. These functions must be supported by your timer
	  driver: timer_early_get_count() and timer_early_get_rate().

config ALTERA_TIMER
	bool "Altera timer support"
	depends on TIMER
	help
	  Select this to enable a timer for Altera devices. Please find
	  details on the "Embedded Peripherals IP User Guide" of Altera.

config SANDBOX_TIMER
	bool "Sandbox timer support"
	depends on SANDBOX && TIMER
	help
	  Select this to enable an emulated timer for sandbox. It gets
	  time from host os.

config X86_TSC_TIMER
	bool "x86 Time-Stamp Counter (TSC) timer support"
	depends on TIMER && X86
	default y if X86
	help
	  Select this to enable Time-Stamp Counter (TSC) timer for x86.

config OMAP_TIMER
	bool "Omap timer support"
	depends on TIMER
	help
	  Select this to enable an timer for Omap devices.

config AST_TIMER
	bool "Aspeed ast2400/ast2500 timer support"
	depends on TIMER
	default y if ARCH_ASPEED
	help
	  Select this to enable timer for Aspeed ast2400/ast2500 devices.
	  This is a simple sys timer driver, it is compatible with lib/time.c,
	  but does not support any interrupts. Even though SoC has 8 hardware
	  counters, they are all treated as a single device by this driver.
	  This is mostly because they all share several registers which
	  makes it difficult to completely separate them.

config STI_TIMER
	bool "STi timer support"
	depends on TIMER
	default y if ARCH_STI
	help
	  Select this to enable a timer for STi devices.

config ARC_TIMER
	bool "ARC timer support"
	depends on TIMER && ARC && CLK
	help
	  Select this to enable built-in ARC timers.
	  ARC cores may have up to 2 built-in timers: timer0 and timer1,
	  usually at least one of them exists. Either of them is supported
	  in U-Boot.
