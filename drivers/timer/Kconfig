config TIMER
	bool "Enable driver model for timer drivers"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable driver model for timer access. It uses the same API as
	  lib/time.c, but now implemented by the uclass. The first timer
	  will be used. The timer is usually a 32 bits free-running up
	  counter. There may be no real tick, and no timer interrupt.

config SPL_TIMER
	bool "Enable driver model for timer drivers in SPL"
	depends on TIMER && SPL
	help
	  Enable support for timer drivers in SPL. These can be used to get
	  a timer value when in SPL, or perhaps for implementing a delay
	  function. This enables the drivers in drivers/timer as part of an
	  SPL build.

config TPL_TIMER
	bool "Enable driver model for timer drivers in TPL"
	depends on TIMER && TPL
	help
	  Enable support for timer drivers in TPL. These can be used to get
	  a timer value when in TPL, or perhaps for implementing a delay
	  function. This enables the drivers in drivers/timer as part of an
	  TPL build.

config VPL_TIMER
	bool "Enable driver model for timer drivers in VPL"
	depends on TIMER && VPL
	default y if TPL_TIMER
	help
	  Enable support for timer drivers in VPL. These can be used to get
	  a timer value when in VPL, or perhaps for implementing a delay
	  function. This enables the drivers in drivers/timer as part of an
	  TPL build.

config TIMER_EARLY
	bool "Allow timer to be used early in U-Boot"
	depends on TIMER
	# initr_bootstage() requires a timer and is called before initr_dm()
	# so only the early timer is available
	default y if X86 && BOOTSTAGE
	help
	  In some cases the timer must be accessible before driver model is
	  active. Examples include when using CONFIG_TRACE to trace U-Boot's
	  execution before driver model is set up. Enable this option to
	  use an early timer. These functions must be supported by your timer
	  driver: timer_early_get_count() and timer_early_get_rate().

config ADI_SC5XX_TIMER
	bool "ADI ADSP-SC5xx Timer Support"
	depends on TIMER && (SC57X || SC58X || SC59X || SC59X_64)
	help
	  gptimer based timer support on ADI's ADSP-SC5xx platforms. Available
	  but not required on sc59x-64-based platforms (598 and similar).
	  Required on 32-bit platforms (sc57x, sc58x, sc594 and earlier).

config ALTERA_TIMER

	bool "ARC timer support"
	depends on TIMER && ARC && CLK
	help
	  Select this to enable built-in ARC timers.
	  ARC cores may have up to 2 built-in timers: timer0 and timer1,
	  usually at least one of them exists. Either of them is supported
	  in U-Boot.

config ARM_TWD_TIMER
	bool "ARM timer watchdog (TWD) timer support"
	depends on TIMER && CLK
	help
	  Select this to enable support for the ARM global timer watchdog timer.

config AST_TIMER
	bool "Aspeed ast2400/ast2500 timer support"
	depends on TIMER
	default y if ARCH_ASPEED
	help
	  Select this to enable timer for Aspeed ast2400/ast2500 devices.
	  This is a simple sys timer driver, it is compatible with lib/time.c,
	  but does not support any interrupts. Even though SoC has 8 hardware
	  counters, they are all treated as a single device by this driver.
	  This is mostly because they all share several registers which
	  makes it difficult to completely separate them.

config AST_IBEX_TIMER
	bool "Aspeed ast2700 Ibex timer"
	depends on TIMER
	help
	  Select this to enable a timer support for the Ibex RV32-based MCUs in AST2700.

config X86_TSC_READ_BASE
	bool "Read the TSC timer base on start-up"
	depends on X86_TSC_TIMER
	help
	  On x86 platforms the TSC timer tick starts at the value 0 on reset.
	  This it makes no sense to read the timer on boot and use that as the
	  base, since we will miss some time taken to load U-Boot, etc. This
	  delay is controlled by the SoC and we cannot reduce it, but for
	  bootstage we want to record the time since reset as accurately as
	  possible.

	  The only exception is when U-Boot is used as a secondary bootloader,
	  where this option should be enabled.
