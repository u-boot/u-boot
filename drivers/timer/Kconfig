config TIMER
	bool "Enable driver model for timer drivers"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable driver model for timer access. It uses the same API as
	  lib/time.c, but now implemented by the uclass. The first timer
	  will be used. The timer is usually a 32 bits free-running up
	  counter. There may be no real tick, and no timer interrupt.

config TIMER_EARLY
	bool "Allow timer to be used early in U-Boot"
	depends on TIMER
	help
	  In some cases the timer must be accessible before driver model is
	  active. Examples include when using CONFIG_TRACE to trace U-Boot's
	  execution before driver model is set up. Enable this option to
	  use an early timer. These functions must be supported by your timer
	  driver: timer_early_get_count() and timer_early_get_rate().

	depends on TIMER
	help
