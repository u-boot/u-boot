Existence of separate Tegra124 video implementations is not an ideal solution
since generic video setup for Tegra already has Tegra124 support of some degree.
It is not possible at the time of this note is written to integrate T124 SOR
and DP without possible regressions. Tegra124 setup for SOR and DP should be
incorporated into existing setup once such opportunity occurs.
