config OF_REAL
	bool
	help
	  Indicates that a real devicetree is available which can be accessed
	  at runtime. This means that dev_read_...() functions can be used to
	  read data from the devicetree for each device. This is true if
	  OF_CONTROL is enabled in U-Boot proper.

config OF_BOARD_FIXUP
	bool "Board-specific manipulation of Device Tree"
	help
	  In certain circumstances it is necessary to be able to modify
	  U-Boot's device tree (e.g. to delete device from it). This option
	  make the Device Tree writeable and provides a board-specific
	  "board_fix_fdt" callback (called during pre-relocation time), which
	  enables the board initialization to modifiy the Device Tree. The
	  modified copy is subsequently used by U-Boot after relocation.

config OF_LIVE
	bool "Enable use of a live tree"
	depends on DM && OF_CONTROL
	help
	  Normally U-Boot uses a flat device tree which saves space and
	  avoids the need to unpack the tree before use. However a flat
	  tree does not support modification from within U-Boot since it
	  can invalidate driver-model device tree offsets. This option
	  enables a live tree which is available after relocation,
	  and can be adjusted as needed.

	  If this option is enabled, the device tree will be picked up and
	  built into the U-Boot image. This is suitable for local debugging
	  and development only and is not recommended for production devices.
	  Boards in the mainline U-Boot tree should not use it.

	help
	  If this option is enabled, the device tree is provided at runtime by
	  a custom function called board_fdt_blob_setup(). The board must
	  implement this function if it wishes to provide special behaviour.

	  With this option, the device tree build by U-Boot may be overridden or
	  ignored. See OF_HAS_PRIOR_STAGE.

	  Note: Boards which use this to handle a device tree passed from an
	  earlier stage should enable OF_HAS_PRIOR_STAGE.

config OF_HAS_PRIOR_STAGE
	bool
	help
	  Indicates that a prior stage of the firmware (before U-Boot proper)
	  makes use of device tree and this board normally boots with that prior
	  stage, that provides a devicetree to U-Boot.

	  This means that the device tree built in U-Boot should not be packaged
	  in the firmware image. Instead, the prior stage's device tree should
	  be so packaged. At runtime, the prior stage reads this, does any
	  necessary fix-ups, then passes it to U-Boot. See OF_BOARD.

	  This option does not preclude using the U-Boot device tree, e.g. for
	  development purposes, but it is not recommended, and likely will not
	  even work, for production systems.

	  Note: This option must be set in Kconfig and cannot be enabled or
	  disabled in the board's defconfig file.

	  As a special case, avoid writing a device tree file u-boot.dtb when
	  building. Also don't include that file in u-boot.bin

	  This is used for boards which normally provide a devicetree via a
	  runtime mechanism (such as OF_BOARD), to avoid confusion.

	  control. These will be packaged into a FIT. At run-time, U-boot
	  or SPL will select the correct DT to use by examining the
	  hardware (e.g. reading a board ID value). This is a list of

	  This option provides hooks to allow U-boot to parse an

	  This allows using the same SPL binary on multiple platforms.
