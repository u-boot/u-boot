title: Generic 8-bit shift register

description: |
  NOTE: These chips nominally don't have a chip select pin. They do however
  have a rising-edge triggered latch clock (or storage register clock) pin,
  which behaves like an active-low chip select.

  After the bits are shifted into the shift register, CS# is driven high, which
  the 74HC595 sees as a rising edge on the latch clock that results in a
  transfer of the bits from the shift register to the storage register and thus
  to the output pins.
