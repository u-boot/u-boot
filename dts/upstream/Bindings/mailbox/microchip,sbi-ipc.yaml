  The Microchip Inter-processor Communication (IPC) facilitates
  message passing between processors using an interrupt signaling
  mechanism.

  "#mbox-cells":
    description: >
      For "microchip,sbi-ipc", the cell represents the global "logical"
      channel IDs. The meaning of channel IDs are platform firmware dependent.

      For "microchip,miv-ihc-rtl-v2", the cell represents the physical
      channel and does not vary based on the platform firmware.
    const: 1

  microchip,ihc-chan-disabled-mask:
    description: >
      Represents the enable/disable state of the bi-directional IHC
      channels within the MIV-IHC IP configuration.

      A bit set to '1' indicates that the corresponding channel is disabled,
      and any read or write operations to that channel will return zero.

      A bit set to '0' indicates that the corresponding channel is enabled
      and will be accessible through its dedicated address range registers.

      The actual enable/disable state of each channel is determined by the
      IP blockâ€™s configuration.

            The 'microchip,sbi-ipc' operates in a programming model
            that does not require memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) registers
            since it uses SBI ecalls provided by the m-mode/firmware
            SBI implementation to access hardware registers.
