title: MMC Controller Common Properties

description:
  These properties are common to multiple MMC host controllers. Any host
  that requires the respective functionality should implement them using
  these definitions.

  It is possible to assign a fixed index mmcN to an MMC host controller
  (and the corresponding mmcblkN devices) by defining an alias in the
  /aliases device tree node.
