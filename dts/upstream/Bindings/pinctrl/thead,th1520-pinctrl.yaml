description: |
  Pinmux and pinconf controller in the T-Head TH1520 RISC-V SoC.

  The TH1520 has 3 groups of pads each controlled from different memory ranges.
  Confusingly the memory ranges are named
    PADCTRL_AOSYS  -> PAD Group 1
    PADCTRL1_APSYS -> PAD Group 2
    PADCTRL0_APSYS -> PAD Group 3

  Each pad can be muxed individually to up to 6 different functions. For most
  pads only a few of those 6 configurations are valid though, and a few pads in
  group 1 does not support muxing at all.

  Pinconf is fairly regular except for a few pads in group 1 that either can't
  be configured or has some special functions. The rest have configurable drive
  strength, input enable, schmitt trigger, slew rate, pull-up and pull-down in
  addition to a special strong pull up.

  Certain pads in group 1 can be muxed to AUDIO_PA0 - AUDIO_PA30 functions and
  are then meant to be used by the audio co-processor. Each such pad can then
  be further muxed to either audio GPIO or one of 4 functions such as UART, I2C
  and I2S. If the audio pad is muxed to one of the 4 functions then pinconf is
  also configured in different registers. All of this is done from a different
  AUDIO_IOCTRL memory range and is left to the audio co-processor for now.
