 * The A9 was made by two separate fabs on two different process
 * nodes: Samsung made the S8000 (APL0898) on 14nm and TSMC made
 * the S8003 (APL1022) on 16nm. While they are seemingly the same,
 * they do have distinct part numbers and devices using them have
 * distinct model names. There are currently no known differences
 * between these as far as Linux is concerned, but let's keep things
 * structured properly to make it easier to alter the behaviour of
 * one of the chips if need be.
