	  At present the environment can be stored in only one place. Use this
	  option to select the location. This is either a device (where the
	  environemnt information is simply written to a fixed location or
	  partition on the device) or a filesystem (where the environment
	  information is written to a file).

config ENV_IS_NOWHERE
	bool "Environment is not stored"
	help
	  Define this if you don't want to or can't have an environment stored
	  on a storage medium. In this case the environemnt will still exist
	  while U-Boot is running, but once U-Boot exits it will not be
	  stored. U-Boot will therefore always start up with a default
	  environment.

config ENV_IS_IN_EEPROM
	bool "Environment in EEPROM"
	depends on !CHAIN_OF_TRUST
	help
	  Use this if you have an EEPROM or similar serial access
	  device and a driver for it.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET:
	  - CONFIG_ENV_SIZE:

	  These two #defines specify the offset and size of the
	  environment area within the total memory of your EEPROM.

	  Note that we consider the length of the address field to
	  still be one byte because the extra address bits are hidden
	  in the chip address.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_EEPROM_IS_ON_I2C
	  define this, if you have I2C and SPI activated, and your
	  EEPROM, which holds the environment, is on the I2C bus.

	  - CONFIG_I2C_ENV_EEPROM_BUS
	  if you have an Environment on an EEPROM reached over
	  I2C muxes, you can define here, how to reach this
	  EEPROM. For example:

	  #define CONFIG_I2C_ENV_EEPROM_BUS	  1

	  EEPROM which holds the environment, is reached over
	  a pca9547 i2c mux with address 0x70, channel 3.

config ENV_IS_IN_FAT
	bool "Environment is in a FAT filesystem"
	depends on !CHAIN_OF_TRUST
	select FAT_WRITE
	help
	  Define this if you want to use the FAT file system for the environment.

	  - CONFIG_FAT_WRITE:
	  This must be enabled. Otherwise it cannot save the environment file.

config ENV_IS_IN_FLASH
	bool "Environment in flash memory"
	depends on !CHAIN_OF_TRUST
	help
	  Define this if you have a flash device which you want to use for the
	  environment.

	  a) The environment occupies one whole flash sector, which is
	   "embedded" in the text segment with the U-Boot code. This
	   happens usually with "bottom boot sector" or "top boot
	   sector" type flash chips, which have several smaller
	   sectors at the start or the end. For instance, such a
	   layout can have sector sizes of 8, 2x4, 16, Nx32 kB. In
	   such a case you would place the environment in one of the
	   4 kB sectors - with U-Boot code before and after it. With
	   "top boot sector" type flash chips, you would put the
	   environment in one of the last sectors, leaving a gap
	   between U-Boot and the environment.

	  CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET:

	   Offset of environment data (variable area) to the
	   beginning of flash memory; for instance, with bottom boot
	   type flash chips the second sector can be used: the offset
	   for this sector is given here.

	   CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET is used relative to CONFIG_SYS_FLASH_BASE.

	  CONFIG_ENV_ADDR:

	   This is just another way to specify the start address of
	   the flash sector containing the environment (instead of
	   CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET).

	  CONFIG_ENV_SECT_SIZE:

	   Size of the sector containing the environment.


	  b) Sometimes flash chips have few, equal sized, BIG sectors.
	   In such a case you don't want to spend a whole sector for
	   the environment.

	  CONFIG_ENV_SIZE:

	   If you use this in combination with CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_FLASH
	   and CONFIG_ENV_SECT_SIZE, you can specify to use only a part
	   of this flash sector for the environment. This saves
	   memory for the RAM copy of the environment.

	   It may also save flash memory if you decide to use this
	   when your environment is "embedded" within U-Boot code,
	   since then the remainder of the flash sector could be used
	   for U-Boot code. It should be pointed out that this is
	   STRONGLY DISCOURAGED from a robustness point of view:
	   updating the environment in flash makes it always
	   necessary to erase the WHOLE sector. If something goes
	   wrong before the contents has been restored from a copy in
	   RAM, your target system will be dead.

	  CONFIG_ENV_ADDR_REDUND
	  CONFIG_ENV_SIZE_REDUND

	   These settings describe a second storage area used to hold
	   a redundant copy of the environment data, so that there is
	   a valid backup copy in case there is a power failure during
	   a "saveenv" operation.

	  BE CAREFUL! Any changes to the flash layout, and some changes to the
	  source code will make it necessary to adapt <board>/u-boot.lds*
	  accordingly!

config ENV_IS_IN_MMC
	bool "Environment in an MMC device"
	depends on !CHAIN_OF_TRUST
	help
	  Define this if you have an MMC device which you want to use for the
	  environment.

	  CONFIG_SYS_MMC_ENV_DEV:

	  Specifies which MMC device the environment is stored in.

	  CONFIG_SYS_MMC_ENV_PART (optional):

	  Specifies which MMC partition the environment is stored in. If not
	  set, defaults to partition 0, the user area. Common values might be
	  1 (first MMC boot partition), 2 (second MMC boot partition).

	  CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET:
	  CONFIG_ENV_SIZE:

	  These two #defines specify the offset and size of the environment
	  area within the specified MMC device.

	  If offset is positive (the usual case), it is treated as relative to
	  the start of the MMC partition. If offset is negative, it is treated
	  as relative to the end of the MMC partition. This can be useful if
	  your board may be fitted with different MMC devices, which have
	  different sizes for the MMC partitions, and you always want the
	  environment placed at the very end of the partition, to leave the
	  maximum possible space before it, to store other data.

	  These two values are in units of bytes, but must be aligned to an
	  MMC sector boundary.

	  CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND (optional):

	  Specifies a second storage area, of CONFIG_ENV_SIZE size, used to
	  hold a redundant copy of the environment data. This provides a
	  valid backup copy in case the other copy is corrupted, e.g. due
	  to a power failure during a "saveenv" operation.

	  This value may also be positive or negative; this is handled in the
	  same way as CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET.

	  This value is also in units of bytes, but must also be aligned to
	  an MMC sector boundary.

	  CONFIG_ENV_SIZE_REDUND (optional):

	  This value need not be set, even when CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND is
	  set. If this value is set, it must be set to the same value as
	  CONFIG_ENV_SIZE.

config ENV_IS_IN_NAND
	bool "Environment in a NAND device"
	depends on !CHAIN_OF_TRUST
	help
	  Define this if you have a NAND device which you want to use for the
	  environment.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET:
	  - CONFIG_ENV_SIZE:

	  These two #defines specify the offset and size of the environment
	  area within the first NAND device.  CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET must be
	  aligned to an erase block boundary.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND (optional):

	  This setting describes a second storage area of CONFIG_ENV_SIZE
	  size used to hold a redundant copy of the environment data, so
	  that there is a valid backup copy in case there is a power failure
	  during a "saveenv" operation.	 CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND must be
	  aligned to an erase block boundary.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_RANGE (optional):

	  Specifies the length of the region in which the environment
	  can be written.  This should be a multiple of the NAND device's
	  block size.  Specifying a range with more erase blocks than
	  are needed to hold CONFIG_ENV_SIZE allows bad blocks within
	  the range to be avoided.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_OOB (optional):

	  Enables support for dynamically retrieving the offset of the
	  environment from block zero's out-of-band data.  The
	  "nand env.oob" command can be used to record this offset.
	  Currently, CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND is not supported when
	  using CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_OOB.

config ENV_IS_IN_NVRAM
	bool "Environment in a non-volatile RAM"
	depends on !CHAIN_OF_TRUST
	help
	  Define this if you have some non-volatile memory device
	  (NVRAM, battery buffered SRAM) which you want to use for the
	  environment.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_ADDR:
	  - CONFIG_ENV_SIZE:

	  These two #defines are used to determine the memory area you
	  want to use for environment. It is assumed that this memory
	  can just be read and written to, without any special
	  provision.

config ENV_IS_IN_ONENAND
	bool "Environment is in OneNAND"
	depends on !CHAIN_OF_TRUST
	help
	  Define this if you want to put your local device's environment in
	  OneNAND.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_ADDR:
	  - CONFIG_ENV_SIZE:

	  These two #defines are used to determine the device range you
	  want to use for environment. It is assumed that this memory
	  can just be read and written to, without any special
	  provision.

config ENV_IS_IN_REMOTE
	bool "Environment is in remove memory space"
	depends on !CHAIN_OF_TRUST
	help
	  Define this if you have a remote memory space which you
	  want to use for the local device's environment.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_ADDR:
	  - CONFIG_ENV_SIZE:

	  These two #defines specify the address and size of the
	  environment area within the remote memory space. The
	  local device can get the environment from remote memory
	  space by SRIO or PCIE links.

config ENV_IS_IN_SPI_FLASH
	bool "Environment is in SPI flash"
	depends on !CHAIN_OF_TRUST
	help
	  Define this if you have a SPI Flash memory device which you
	  want to use for the environment.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET:
	  - CONFIG_ENV_SIZE:

	  These two #defines specify the offset and size of the
	  environment area within the SPI Flash. CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET must be
	  aligned to an erase sector boundary.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_SECT_SIZE:

	  Define the SPI flash's sector size.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND (optional):

	  This setting describes a second storage area of CONFIG_ENV_SIZE
	  size used to hold a redundant copy of the environment data, so
	  that there is a valid backup copy in case there is a power failure
	  during a "saveenv" operation. CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND must be
	  aligned to an erase sector boundary.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_SPI_BUS (optional):
	  - CONFIG_ENV_SPI_CS (optional):

	  Define the SPI bus and chip select. If not defined they will be 0.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_SPI_MAX_HZ (optional):

	  Define the SPI max work clock. If not defined then use 1MHz.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_SPI_MODE (optional):

	  Define the SPI work mode. If not defined then use SPI_MODE_3.

config ENV_IS_IN_UBI
	bool "Environment in a UBI volume"
	depends on !CHAIN_OF_TRUST
	help
	  Define this if you have an UBI volume that you want to use for the
	  environment.  This has the benefit of wear-leveling the environment
	  accesses, which is important on NAND.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_UBI_PART:

	  Define this to a string that is the mtd partition containing the UBI.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_UBI_VOLUME:

	  Define this to the name of the volume that you want to store the
	  environment in.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_UBI_VOLUME_REDUND:

	  Define this to the name of another volume to store a second copy of
	  the environment in.  This will enable redundant environments in UBI.
	  It is assumed that both volumes are in the same MTD partition.

	  - CONFIG_UBI_SILENCE_MSG
	  - CONFIG_UBIFS_SILENCE_MSG

	  You will probably want to define these to avoid a really noisy system
	  when storing the env in UBI.
