config FS_CBFS
	bool "Enable CBFS (Coreboot Filesystem)"
	help
	  Define this to enable support for reading from a Coreboot
	  filesystem. This is a ROM-based filesystem used for accessing files
	  on systems that use coreboot as the first boot-loader and then load
	  U-Boot to actually boot the Operating System. You can also enable
	  CMD_CBFS to get command-line access.

config SPL_FS_CBFS
	bool "Enable CBFS (Coreboot Filesystem) in SPL"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Define this to enable support for reading from a Coreboot
	  filesystem. This is a ROM-based filesystem used for accessing files
	  on systems that use coreboot as the first boot-loader and then load
	  U-Boot to actually boot the Operating System.

	  Note that most functions in the CBFS API do not work with SPL. Only
	  those which accept a cbfs_priv * can be used, since BSS is not
	  available.
