 * that BITMAP_SIZE(n) is 1, i.e. 1 <= n <= BITS_PER_LONG. This allows
 * various bit/bitmap APIs to provide a fast inline implementation. Bitmaps
 * of size 0 are very rare, and a compile-time-known-size 0 is most likely
 * a sign of error. They will be handled correctly by the bit/bitmap APIs,
 * but using the out-of-line functions, so that the inline implementations
 * can unconditionally dereference the pointer(s).
