/**
 * struct bootflow_iter - state for iterating through bootflows
 *
 * This starts at with the first bootdev/partition/bootmeth and can be used to

 *
 * Iteration starts with the bootdev. The first partition (0, i.e. whole device)
 * is scanned first. For partition 0, it iterates through all the available
 * bootmeths to see which one(s) can provide a bootflow. Then it moves to
 * parition 1 (if there is one) and the process continues. Once all partitions
 * are examined, it moves to the next bootdev.
 *
 * Initially @max_part is 0, meaning that only the whole device (@part=0) can be
 * used. During scanning, if a partition table is found, then @max_part is
 * updated to a larger value, no less than the number of available partitions.
 * This ensures that iteration works through all partitions on the bootdev.

 *	BOOTFLOWIF_GLOBAL_FIRST is enabled then the global bootmeths are being
 *	scanned, otherwise we have moved onto the bootdevs
 * @dev: Current bootdev, NULL if none. This is only ever updated in
 * bootflow_iter_set_dev()
 * @part: Current partition number (0 for whole device)
 * @method: Current bootmeth
 * @max_part: Maximum hardware partition number in @dev, 0 if there is no
 *	partition table
 * @first_bootable: First bootable partition, or 0 if none
 * @err: Error obtained from checking the last iteration. This is used to skip
 *	forward (e.g. to skip the current partition because it is not valid)
 *	-ESHUTDOWN: try next bootdev
 * @num_devs: Number of bootdevs in @dev_used
 * @max_devs: Maximum number of entries in @dev_used
