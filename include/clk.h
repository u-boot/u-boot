/**
 * DOC: Overview
 *
 * A clock is a hardware signal that oscillates autonomously at a specific
 * frequency and duty cycle. Most hardware modules require one or more clock
 * signal to drive their operation. Clock signals are typically generated
 * externally to the HW module consuming them, by an entity this API calls a
 * clock provider. This API provides a standard means for drivers to enable and
 * disable clocks, and to set the rate at which they oscillate.
 *
 * A driver that implements UCLASS_CLK is a clock provider. A provider will
 * often implement multiple separate clocks, since the hardware it manages
 * often has this capability. clk-uclass.h describes the interface which
 * clock providers must implement.
 *
 * Clock consumers/clients are the HW modules driven by the clock signals. This
 * header file describes the API used by drivers for those HW modules.

 *         Clock IP blocks specific flags (i.e. mux, div, gate, etc) are defined
 *         in struct's for those devices (e.g. &struct clk_mux).
 * @enable_count: The number of times this clock has been enabled.
 * @id: The clock signal ID within the provider.

 *
 * Clients provide storage for clock handles. The content of the structure is
 * managed solely by the clock API and clock drivers. A clock struct is
