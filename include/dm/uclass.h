/**
 * struct uclass - a U-Boot drive class, collecting together similar drivers
 *
 * A uclass provides an interface to a particular function, which is
 * implemented by one or more drivers. Every driver belongs to a uclass even
 * if it is the only driver in that uclass. An example uclass is GPIO, which
 * provides the ability to change read inputs, set and clear outputs, etc.
 * There may be drivers for on-chip SoC GPIO banks, I2C GPIO expanders and
 * PMIC IO lines, all made available in a unified way through the uclass.
 *
 * @priv_: Private data for this uclass (do not access outside driver model)
 * @uc_drv: The driver for the uclass itself, not to be confused with a
 * 'struct driver'
 * @dev_head: List of devices in this uclass (devices are attached to their
 * uclass when their bind method is called)
 * @sibling_node: Next uclass in the linked list of uclasses
