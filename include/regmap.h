/**
 * DOC: Overview
 *
 * Regmaps are an abstraction mechanism that allows device drivers to access
 * register maps irrespective of the underlying bus architecture. This entails
 * that for devices that support multiple busses (e.g. I2C and SPI for a GPIO
 * expander chip) only one driver has to be written. This driver will
 * instantiate a regmap with a backend depending on the bus the device is
 * attached to, and use the regmap API to access the register map through that
 * bus transparently.
 *
 * Read and write functions are supplied, which can read/write data of
 * arbitrary length from/to the regmap.
 *
 * The endianness of regmap accesses is selectable for each map through device
 * tree settings via the boolean "little-endian", "big-endian", and
 * "native-endian" properties.
 *
 * Furthermore, the register map described by a regmap can be split into
 * multiple disjoint areas called ranges. In this way, register maps with
 * "holes", i.e. areas of addressable memory that are not part of the register
 * map, can be accessed in a concise manner.
 *
 * Currently, only a bare "mem" backend for regmaps is supported, which
 * accesses the register map as regular IO-mapped memory.
