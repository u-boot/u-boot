config CC_OPTIMIZE_LIBS_FOR_SPEED
	bool "Optimize libraries for speed"
	help
	  Enabling this option will pass "-O2" to gcc when compiling
	  under "lib" directory.

	  If unsure, say N.

config HAVE_PRIVATE_LIBGCC
	bool

config USE_PRIVATE_LIBGCC
	bool "Use private libgcc"
	depends on HAVE_PRIVATE_LIBGCC
	default y if HAVE_PRIVATE_LIBGCC && ((ARM && !ARM64) || MIPS)
	help
	  This option allows you to use the built-in libgcc implementation
	  of U-Boot instead of the one provided by the compiler.
	  If unsure, say N.

config SYS_HZ
	int
	default 1000
	help
	  The frequency of the timer returned by get_timer().
	  get_timer() must operate in milliseconds and this option must be
	  set to 1000.

config USE_TINY_PRINTF
	bool "Enable tiny printf() version"
	help
	  This option enables a tiny, stripped down printf version.
	  This should only be used in space limited environments,
	  like SPL versions with hard memory limits. This version
	  reduces the code size by about 2.5KiB on armv7.

	  The supported format specifiers are %c, %s, %u/%d and %x.

config REGEX
	bool "Enable regular expression support"
	default y if NET
	help
	  If this variable is defined, U-Boot is linked against the
	  SLRE (Super Light Regular Expression) library, which adds
	  regex support to some commands, for example "env grep" and
	  "setexpr".

config LIB_RAND
	bool "Pseudo-random library support "
	help
	  This library provides pseudo-random number generator functions.

source lib/dhry/Kconfig

source lib/rsa/Kconfig

config TPM
	bool "Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Support"
	depends on DM
	help
	  This enables support for TPMs which can be used to provide security
	  features for your board. The TPM can be connected via LPC or I2C
	  and a sandbox TPM is provided for testing purposes. Use the 'tpm'
	  command to interactive the TPM. Driver model support is provided
	  for the low-level TPM interface, but only one TPM is supported at
	  a time by the TPM library.

menu "Encryption Support"

config AES
	bool "Enable encryption and decryption support"
	help
	  This config enables support of aes for encryption and
	  decryption of images.
endmenu

menu "Hashing Support"

config SHA1
	bool "Enable SHA1 support"
	help
	  This option enables support of hashing using SHA1 algorithm.
	  The hash is calculated in software.
	  The SHA1 algorithm produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value
	  (digest).

config SHA256
	bool "Enable SHA256 support"
	help
	  This option enables support of hashing using SHA256 algorithm.
	  The hash is calculated in software.
	  The SHA256 algorithm produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value
	  (digest).

config SHA_HW_ACCEL
	bool "Enable hashing using hardware"
	help
	  This option enables hardware acceleration
	  for SHA1/SHA256 hashing.
	  This affects the 'hash' command and also the
	  hash_lookup_algo() function.

config SHA_PROG_HW_ACCEL
	bool "Enable Progressive hashing support using hardware"
	depends on SHA_HW_ACCEL
	help
	  This option enables hardware-acceleration for
	  SHA1/SHA256 progressive hashing.
	  Data can be streamed in a block at a time and the hashing
	  is performed in hardware.
endmenu

menu "Compression Support"

config LZ4
	bool "Enable LZ4 decompression support"
	help
	  If this option is set, support for LZ4 compressed images
	  is included. The LZ4 algorithm can run in-place as long as the
	  compressed image is loaded to the end of the output buffer, and
	  trades lower compression ratios for much faster decompression.
	  
	  NOTE: This implements the release version of the LZ4 frame
	  format as generated by default by the 'lz4' command line tool.
	  This is not the same as the outdated, less efficient legacy
	  frame format currently (2015) implemented in the Linux kernel
	  (generated by 'lz4 -l'). The two formats are incompatible.

config ERRNO_STR
	bool "Enable function for getting errno-related string message"
	help
	  The function errno_str(int errno), returns a pointer to the errno
	  corresponding text message:
	  - if errno is null or positive number - a pointer to "Success" message
	  - if errno is negative - a pointer to errno related message

config OF_LIBFDT
	bool "Enable the FDT library"
	default y if OF_CONTROL
	help
	  This enables the FDT library (libfdt). It provides functions for
	  accessing binary device tree images in memory, such as adding and
	  removing notes and properties, scanning through the tree and finding
	  particular compatible nodes. The library operates on a flattened
	  version of the device tree.

config OF_LIBFDT_OVERLAY
	bool "Enable the FDT library overlay support"
	help
	  This enables the FDT library (libfdt) overlay support.

config SPL_OF_LIBFDT
	bool "Enable the FDT library for SPL"
	default y if SPL_OF_CONTROL
	help
	  This enables the FDT library (libfdt). It provides functions for
	  accessing binary device tree images in memory, such as adding and
	  removing notes and properties, scanning through the tree and finding
	  particular compatible nodes. The library operates on a flattened
	  version of the device tree.

config FDT_FIXUP_PARTITIONS
	bool "overwrite MTD partitions in DTS through defined in 'mtdparts'"
	depends on OF_LIBFDT
	default n
	help
	  Allow overwriting defined partitions in the device tree blob
	  using partition info defined in the 'mtdparts' environment
	  variable.

config GENERATE_SMBIOS_TABLE
	bool "Generate an SMBIOS (System Management BIOS) table"

	help
	  The System Management BIOS (SMBIOS) specification addresses how
	  motherboard and system vendors present management information about
	  their products in a standard format by extending the BIOS interface
	  on Intel architecture systems.
