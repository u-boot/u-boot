	bool "Support running U-Boot from EFI"
	depends on X86
	help
	  U-Boot can be started from EFI on certain platforms. This allows
	  EFI to perform most of the system init and then jump to U-Boot for
	  final system boot. Another option is to run U-Boot as an EFI
	  application, with U-Boot using EFI's drivers instead of its own.

config EFI_APP
	bool "Support running as an EFI application"
	help
	  Build U-Boot as an application which can be started from EFI. This
	  is useful for examining a platform in the early stages of porting
	  U-Boot to it. It allows only very basic functionality, such as a
	  command prompt and memory and I/O functions. Use 'reset' to return
	  to EFI.

	default 0x2000000
	help
	  Set the amount of EFI RAM which is claimed by U-Boot for its own
	  use. U-Boot allocates this from EFI on start-up (along with a few
	  other smaller amounts) and it can never be increased after that.
	  It is used as the RAM size in with U-Boot.
