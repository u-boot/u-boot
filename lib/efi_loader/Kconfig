	  Select this option if you want to run UEFI applications (like GNU
	  GRUB or iPXE) on top of U-Boot. If this option is enabled, U-Boot
	  will expose the UEFI API to a loaded application, enabling it to
	  reuse U-Boot's device drivers.

	  The device path to text protocol converts device nodes and paths to
	  human readable strings.

	bool "HII protocols"
	default y
	help
	  The Human Interface Infrastructure is a complicated framework that
	  allows UEFI applications to draw fancy menus and hook strings using
	  a translation framework.

	  U-Boot implements enough of its features to be able to run the UEFI
	  Shell, but not more than that.

	  The Unicode collation protocol is used for lexical comparisons. It is

	  Select this option to enable correct handling of the capitalization of

	  used by the FAT file system is ensured.

	  This value is used to initialize the PlatformLangCodes variable. Its

	  RFC 4646 format, e.g. "en-US;de-DE". The first language code is used
	  to initialize the PlatformLang variable.
