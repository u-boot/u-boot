    DESCRIPTION
            "This MIB module defines the IANAscopeSource and
            IANAmallocRangeSource textual conventions for use in MIBs
            which need to identify ways of learning multicast scope and
            range information.

            Any additions or changes to the contents of this MIB module
            require either publication of an RFC, or Designated Expert
            Review as defined in the Guidelines for Writing IANA
            Considerations Section document.  The Designated Expert will
            be selected by the IESG Area Director(s) of the Transport
            Area."
