HTTPSERVER

This is a demonstration of how to make the most basic kind 
of server using lWIP.

* httpserver-raw.c - uses raw TCP calls (coming soon!)

* httpserver-netconn.c - uses netconn and netbuf API

This code updates the examples in Adam Dunkel's original
lwIP documentation to match changes in the code since that
PDF release.
