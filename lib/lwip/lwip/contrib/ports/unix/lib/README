This directory contains an example of how to compile lwIP as a shared library
on Linux.

Some brief instructions:

* Compile the code:

 > mkdir build
 > cd build
 > cmake ..
 > make clean all

 This should produce liblwip.so. This is the shared library.

* Link an application against the shared library

 If you're using gcc you can do this by including -llwip in your link command.

* Run your application

 Ensure that LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes the directory that contains liblwip.so
 (ie. this directory)

general, you might find this HOWTO useful:
