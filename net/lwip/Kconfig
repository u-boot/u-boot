	select PROT_ICMP_LWIP
	help
	  Prints a message whenever an ICMP Destination Unreachable message is
	  received while running a network command that sends requests via UDP.
	  Enabling this can make troubleshooting easier.

config LWIP_DEBUG
	bool "Enable debug traces in the lwIP library"
	help
	  Prints messages to the console regarding network packets that go in
          and out of the lwIP library.

config LWIP_DEBUG_RXTX
	bool "Dump packets sent and received by lwIP"
	help
	  Performs an hexadecimal & ASCII dump of the data received and sent by
	  the lwIP network stack.

config LWIP_ASSERT
	bool "Enable assertions in the lwIP library"
	help
	  Compiles additional error checking code into the lwIP library. These
	  checks are related to conditions that should not happen in typical
	  use, but may be helpful to debug new features.

	  Default value for TCP_WND in the lwIP configuration
	  Lower values result in slower wget transfer speeds in
	  general, especially when the latency on the network is high,
	  but QEMU with "-net user" needs no more than a few KB or the
	  transfer will stall and eventually time out.

	  "tftpserverip")
