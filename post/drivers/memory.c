/* Memory test
 *
 * General observations:
 * o The recommended test sequence is to test the data lines: if they are
 *   broken, nothing else will work properly.  Then test the address
 *   lines.  Finally, test the cells in the memory now that the test
 *   program knows that the address and data lines work properly.
 *   This sequence also helps isolate and identify what is faulty.
 *
 * o For the address line test, it is a good idea to use the base
 *   address of the lowest memory location, which causes a '1' bit to
 *   walk through a field of zeros on the address lines and the highest
 *   memory location, which causes a '0' bit to walk through a field of
 *   '1's on the address line.
 *
 * o Floating buses can fool memory tests if the test routine writes
 *   a value and then reads it back immediately.  The problem is, the
 *   write will charge the residual capacitance on the data bus so the
 *   bus retains its state briefely.  When the test program reads the
 *   value back immediately, the capacitance of the bus can allow it
 *   to read back what was written, even though the memory circuitry
 *   is broken.  To avoid this, the test program should write a test
 *   pattern to the target location, write a different pattern elsewhere
 *   to charge the residual capacitance in a differnt manner, then read
 *   the target location back.
 *
 * o Always read the target location EXACTLY ONCE and save it in a local
 *   variable.  The problem with reading the target location more than
 *   once is that the second and subsequent reads may work properly,
 *   resulting in a failed test that tells the poor technician that
 *   "Memory error at 00000000, wrote aaaaaaaa, read aaaaaaaa" which
 *   doesn't help him one bit and causes puzzled phone calls.  Been there,
 *   done that.
 *
 * Data line test:
 * ---------------
 * This tests data lines for shorts and opens by forcing adjacent data
 * to opposite states. Because the data lines could be routed in an
 * arbitrary manner the must ensure test patterns ensure that every case
 * is tested. By using the following series of binary patterns every
 * combination of adjacent bits is test regardless of routing.
 *
 *     ...101010101010101010101010
 *     ...110011001100110011001100
 *     ...111100001111000011110000
 *     ...111111110000000011111111
 *
 * Carrying this out, gives us six hex patterns as follows:
 *
 *     0xaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 *     0xcccccccccccccccc
 *     0xf0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0
 *     0xff00ff00ff00ff00
 *     0xffff0000ffff0000
 *     0xffffffff00000000
 *
 * To test for short and opens to other signals on our boards, we
 * simply test with the 1's complemnt of the paterns as well, resulting
 * in twelve patterns total.
 *
 * After writing a test pattern. a special pattern 0x0123456789ABCDEF is
 * written to a different address in case the data lines are floating.
 * Thus, if a byte lane fails, you will see part of the special
 * pattern in that byte lane when the test runs.  For example, if the
 * xx__xxxxxxxxxxxx byte line fails, you will see aa23aaaaaaaaaaaa
 * (for the 'a' test pattern).
 *
 * Address line test:
 * ------------------
 *  This function performs a test to verify that all the address lines
 *  hooked up to the RAM work properly.  If there is an address line
 *  fault, it usually shows up as two different locations in the address
 *  map (related by the faulty address line) mapping to one physical
 *  memory storage location.  The artifact that shows up is writing to
 *  the first location "changes" the second location.
 *
 * To test all address lines, we start with the given base address and
 * xor the address with a '1' bit to flip one address line.  For each
 * test, we shift the '1' bit left to test the next address line.
 *
 * In the actual code, we start with address sizeof(ulong) since our
 * test pattern we use is a ulong and thus, if we tried to test lower
 * order address bits, it wouldn't work because our pattern would
 * overwrite itself.
 *
 * Example for a 4 bit address space with the base at 0000:
 *   0000 <- base
 *   0001 <- test 1
 *   0010 <- test 2
 *   0100 <- test 3
 *   1000 <- test 4
 * Example for a 4 bit address space with the base at 0010:
 *   0010 <- base
 *   0011 <- test 1
 *   0000 <- (below the base address, skipped)
 *   0110 <- test 2
 *   1010 <- test 3
 *
 * The test locations are successively tested to make sure that they are
 * not "mirrored" onto the base address due to a faulty address line.
 * Note that the base and each test location are related by one address
 * line flipped.  Note that the base address need not be all zeros.
 *
 * Memory tests 1-4:
 * -----------------
 * These tests verify RAM using sequential writes and reads
 * to/from RAM. There are several test cases that use different patterns to
 * verify RAM. Each test case fills a region of RAM with one pattern and
 * then reads the region back and compares its contents with the pattern.
 * The following patterns are used:
 *
 *  1a) zero pattern (0x00000000)
 *  1b) negative pattern (0xffffffff)
 *  1c) checkerboard pattern (0x55555555)
 *  1d) checkerboard pattern (0xaaaaaaaa)
 *  2)  bit-flip pattern ((1 << (offset % 32))
 *  3)  address pattern (offset)
 *  4)  address pattern (~offset)
 *
 * Being run in normal mode, the test verifies only small 4Kb
 * regions of RAM around each 1Mb boundary. For example, for 64Mb
 * RAM the following areas are verified: 0x00000000-0x00000800,
 * 0x000ff800-0x00100800, 0x001ff800-0x00200800, ..., 0x03fff800-
 * 0x04000000. If the test is run in slow-test mode, it verifies
 * the whole RAM.
