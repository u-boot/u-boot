"""Support for coreboot's CBFS format

CBFS supports a header followed by a number of files, generally targeted at SPI
flash.

The format is somewhat defined by documentation in the coreboot tree although
it is necessary to rely on the C structures and source code (mostly cbfstool)
to fully understand it.

Currently supported: raw and stage types with compression, padding empty areas
    with empty files, fixed-offset files
