    Note: This should not be used by itself. It is normally used as a parent
    class by other entry types.

    Properties / Entry arguments:
        - filename: Filename of file to read into entry
        - compress: Compression algorithm to use:
            none: No compression
            lz4: Use lz4 compression (via 'lz4' command-line utility)

    This entry reads data from a file and places it in the entry. The
    default filename is often specified specified by the subclass. See for
    example the 'u-boot' entry which provides the filename 'u-boot.bin'.

    If compression is enabled, an extra 'uncomp-size' property is written to
    the node (if enabled with -u) which provides the uncompressed size of the
    data.

        This function compresses the data before returning if needed.

        We assume the data is small enough to fit into memory. If this
        is used for large filesystem image that might not be true.
        In that case, Image.BuildImage() could be adjusted to use a
        new Entry method which can read in chunks. Then we could copy
        the data in chunks and avoid reading it all at once. For now
        this seems like an unnecessary complication.
