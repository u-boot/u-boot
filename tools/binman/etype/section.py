    """Entry that contains other entries

    A section is an entry which can contain other entries, thus allowing
    hierarchical images to be created. See 'Sections and hierarchical images'
    in the binman README for more information.

    The base implementation simply joins the various entries together, using
    various rules about alignment, etc.

    Subclassing
    ~~~~~~~~~~~

    This class can be subclassed to support other file formats which hold
    multiple entries, such as CBFS. To do this, override the following
    functions. The documentation here describes what your function should do.
    For example code, see etypes which subclass `Entry_section`, or `cbfs.py`
    for a more involved example::

       $ grep -l \(Entry_section tools/binman/etype/*.py

    ReadNode()
        Call `super().ReadNode()`, then read any special properties for the
        section. Then call `self.ReadEntries()` to read the entries.

        Binman calls this at the start when reading the image description.

    ReadEntries()
        Read in the subnodes of the section. This may involve creating entries
        of a particular etype automatically, as well as reading any special
        properties in the entries. For each entry, entry.ReadNode() should be
        called, to read the basic entry properties. The properties should be
        added to `self._entries[]`, in the correct order, with a suitable name.

        Binman calls this at the start when reading the image description.

    BuildSectionData(required)
        Create the custom file format that you want and return it as bytes.
        This likely sets up a file header, then loops through the entries,
        adding them to the file. For each entry, call `entry.GetData()` to
        obtain the data. If that returns None, and `required` is False, then
        this method must give up and return None. But if `required` is True then
        it should assume that all data is valid.

        Binman calls this when packing the image, to find out the size of
        everything. It is called again at the end when building the final image.

    SetImagePos(image_pos):
        Call `super().SetImagePos(image_pos)`, then set the `image_pos` values
        for each of the entries. This should use the custom file format to find
        the `start offset` (and `image_pos`) of each entry. If the file format
        uses compression in such a way that there is no offset available (other
        than reading the whole file and decompressing it), then the offsets for
        affected entries can remain unset (`None`). The size should also be set
        if possible.

        Binman calls this after the image has been packed, to update the
        location that all the entries ended up at.

    ReadChildData(child, decomp, alt_format):
        The default version of this may be good enough, if you are able to
        implement SetImagePos() correctly. But that is a bit of a bypass, so
        you can override this method to read from your custom file format. It
        should read the entire entry containing the custom file using
        `super().ReadData(True)`, then parse the file to get the data for the
        given child, then return that data.

        If your file format supports compression, the `decomp` argument tells
        you whether to return the compressed data (`decomp` is False) or to
        uncompress it first, then return the uncompressed data (`decomp` is
        True). This is used by the `binman extract -U` option.

        If your entry supports alternative formats, the alt_format provides the
        alternative format that the user has selected. Your function should
        return data in that format. This is used by the 'binman extract -l'
        option.

        Binman calls this when reading in an image, in order to populate all the
        entries with the data from that image (`binman ls`).

    WriteChildData(child):
        Binman calls this after `child.data` is updated, to inform the custom
        file format about this, in case it needs to do updates.

        The default version of this does nothing and probably needs to be
        overridden for the 'binman replace' command to work. Your version should
        use `child.data` to update the data for that child in the custom file
        format.

        Binman calls this when updating an image that has been read in and in
        particular to update the data for a particular entry (`binman replace`)

    Properties / Entry arguments
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    See :ref:`develop/package/binman:Image description format` for more
    information.

    align-default
        Default alignment for this section, if no alignment is given in the
        entry

    pad-byte
        Pad byte to use when padding

    sort-by-offset
        True if entries should be sorted by offset, False if they must be
        in-order in the device tree description

    end-at-4gb
        Used to build an x86 ROM which ends at 4GB (2^32)

    name-prefix
        Adds a prefix to the name of every entry in the section when writing out
        the map

    skip-at-start
        Number of bytes before the first entry starts. These effectively adjust
        the starting offset of entries. For example, if this is 16, then the
        first entry would start at 16. An entry with offset = 20 would in fact
        be written at offset 4 in the image file, since the first 16 bytes are
        skipped when writing.

    Since a section is also an entry, it inherits all the properies of entries
    too.

    Note that the `allow_missing` member controls whether this section permits
    external blobs to be missing their contents. The option will produce an
    image but of course it will not work. It is useful to make sure that
    Continuous Integration systems can build without the binaries being
    available. This is set by the `SetAllowMissing()` method, if
    `--allow-missing` is passed to binman.
