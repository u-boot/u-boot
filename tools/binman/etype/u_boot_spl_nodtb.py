    Properties / Entry arguments:
        - filename: Filename to include (default 'spl/u-boot-spl-nodtb.bin')

    This is the U-Boot SPL binary, It does not include a device tree blob at
    the end of it so may not be able to work without it, assuming SPL needs
    a device tree to operate on your platform. You can add a u-boot-spl-dtb
    entry after this one, or use a u-boot-spl entry instead' which normally
    expands to a section containing u-boot-spl-dtb, u-boot-spl-bss-pad and
    u-boot-spl-dtb

    SPL can access binman symbols at runtime. See:

        'Access to binman entry offsets at run time (symbols)'

    in the binman README for more information.

    The ELF file 'spl/u-boot-spl' must also be available for this to work, since
    binman uses that to look up symbols to write into the SPL binary.
