    x86 CPUs start up in 16-bit mode, even if they are 32-bit CPUs. This code
    must be placed at a particular address. This entry holds that code. It is
    typically placed at offset CONFIG_RESET_VEC_LOC. The code is responsible
    for jumping to the x86-start16 code, which continues execution.

    For 64-bit U-Boot, the 'x86_reset16_spl' entry type is used instead.
