class Image(section.Entry_section):
    """A Image, representing an output from binman

    An image is comprised of a collection of entries each containing binary
    data. The image size must be large enough to hold all of this data.

    This class implements the various operations needed for images.

    Attributes:
        filename: Output filename for image
        image_node: Name of node containing the description for this image
        fdtmap_dtb: Fdt object for the fdtmap when loading from a file
        fdtmap_data: Contents of the fdtmap when loading from a file
        allow_repack: True to add properties to allow the image to be safely
            repacked later
        test_section_timeout: Use a zero timeout for section multi-threading
            (for testing)
        symlink: Name of symlink to image

    Args:
        copy_to_orig: Copy offset/size to orig_offset/orig_size after reading
            from the device tree
        test: True if this is being called from a test of Images. This this case
            there is no device tree defining the structure of the section, so
            we create a section manually.
        ignore_missing: Ignore any missing entry arguments (i.e. don't raise an
            exception). This should be used if the Image is being loaded from
            a file rather than generated. In that case we obviously don't need
            the entry arguments since the contents already exists.
        use_expanded: True if we are updating the FDT wth entry offsets, etc.
            and should use the expanded versions of the U-Boot entries.
            Any entry type that includes a devicetree must put it in a
            separate entry so that it will be updated. For example. 'u-boot'
            normally just picks up 'u-boot.bin' which includes the
            devicetree, but this is not updateable, since it comes into
            binman as one piece and binman doesn't know that it is actually
            an executable followed by a devicetree. Of course it could be
            taught this, but then when reading an image (e.g. 'binman ls')
            it may need to be able to split the devicetree out of the image
            in order to determine the location of things. Instead we choose
            to ignore 'u-boot-bin' in this case, and build it ourselves in
            binman with 'u-boot-dtb.bin' and 'u-boot.dtb'. See
            Entry_u_boot_expanded and Entry_blob_phase for details.
        missing_etype: Use a default entry type ('blob') if the requested one
            does not exist in binman. This is useful if an image was created by
            binman a newer version of binman but we want to list it in an older
            version which does not support all the entry types.
        generate: If true, generator nodes are processed. If false they are
            ignored which is useful when an existing image is read back from a
            file.
