# This file contains help messages for missing external blobs. Each message has
# a tag (MUST be just lower-case text, digits and hyphens) starting in column 1,
# followed by a colon (:) to indicate its start. The message can include any
# number of lines, including blank lines.
#
# When looking for a tag, Binman uses the value of 'missing-msg' for the entry,
# the entry name or the entry type, in that order

atf-bl31:
See the documentation for your board. You may need to build ARM Trusted

iot2050-seboot:
See the documentation for IOT2050 board. Your image is missing SEBoot
which is mandatory for board startup. Prebuilt SEBoot located at
meta-iot2050/tree/master/recipes-bsp/u-boot/files/prebuild/tiboot3.bin.

iot2050-sysfw:
See the documentation for IOT2050 board. Your image is missing system
firmware which is mandatory for board startup. Prebuilt system firmware
located at meta-iot2050/tree/master/recipes-bsp/u-boot/files/prebuild/
with sysfw prefix.

k3-rti-wdt-firmware:
If CONFIG_WDT_K3_RTI_LOAD_FW is enabled, a firmware image is needed for
the R5F core(s) to trigger the system reset. One possible source is
https://github.com/siemens/k3-rti-wdt.

tee-os:
See the documentation for your board. You may need to build Open Portable
