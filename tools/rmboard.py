Script to remove boards

Usage:
   rmboard.py <board_name>...

A single commit is created for each board removed.

Some boards may depend on files provided by another and this will cause
problems, generally the removal of files which should not be removed.

This script works by:
    - Looking through the MAINTAINERS files which mention a board to find out
        what files the board uses
    - Looking through the Kconfig files which mention a board to find one that
        needs to have material removed

Search for ## to update the commit message manually.

    Kconfig parsing.

    The changes are made locally and then added to the git staging area.
